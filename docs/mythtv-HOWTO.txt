  Initially, installation of MythTV seems like a huge task.  There are
  lots of dependencies, and various distributions seem to do the same
  thing different ways.  This document will attempt to give general
  installation instructions, as well as including distribution-specific
  instructions where necessary.

  [1m1.  First things first.[0m



         [1mNOTE[22m: Please note that I, Robert Kulagowski, am [4mNOT[24m the
  author/programmer of the MythTV application!  I can not give you
  personalized installation support.  If you are having issues
  installing MythTV you should examine the archives, or post your
  question to the MythTV-users mailing list.  If you send me "Does
  MythTV work with 'X'"?  messages - I will simply instruct you to ask
  your question on the mythtv-users mailing list.

  [1m1.1.  What is MythTV?[0m

  MythTV is a GPL licensed suite of programs that allow you to build the
  mythical home media convergence box on your own using Open Source
  software and operating systems.  MythTV is known to work on Linux and
  Mac OS X (PowerPC and Intel).  It does not run on Windows.

  MythTV has a number of capabilities.  The television portion allows
  you to do the following:

  +o  You may pause, fast-forward and rewind live Television.

  +o  You may install multiple video capture cards to record more than
     one program at a time.

  +o  You can have multiple servers (called "backends"), each with
     multiple capture cards in them.  All scheduling is performed by the
     Master backend, which arbitrates which recording will be performed
     by each device.  All recording requests are managed by the Master
     backend, so you can schedule a recording from any client.

  +o  You can have multiple clients (called "frontends" in MythTV
     parlance), each with a common view of all available programs.  Any
     client can watch any program that was recorded by any of the
     servers, assuming that they have the hardware capabilities to view
     the content; a low-powered frontend will not be able to watch HDTV,
     for example.  Clients can be diskless and controlled entirely by a
     remote control.

  +o  You may use any combination of standard analog capture card,
     MPEG-2, MJPEG, DVB, HDTV, USB and firewire capture devices.  With
     appropriate hardware, MythTV can control set top boxes, often found
     in digital cable and satellite TV systems.

  +o  Program Guide Data in North America is downloaded from
     schedulesdirect.org, a non-profit organization which has licensed
     data from Tribune Media Services.  This service provides almost two
     weeks of scheduling information. Program Guide Data in other
     countries is obtained using XMLTV.  MythTV uses this information to
     create a schedule that maximizes the number of programs that can be
     recorded if you don't have enough tuners.

  +o  MythTV implements a UPNP server, so a UPNP client should
     automatically see content from your MythTV system.

     Other modules in MythTV include:

  +o  MythArchive, a tool to create DVDs

  +o  MythBrowser, a web browser

  +o  MythControls, an application to configure your remote control

  +o  MythFlix, a Netflix module

  +o  MythGallery, a picture-viewing application

  +o  MythGame

  +o  MythMusic, a music playing / ripping application which supports MP3
     and FLAC

  +o  MythNews, a RSS news grabber

  +o  MythPhone, phone and videophone using SIP.

  +o  MythVideo, DVD ripper and a media-viewer for content not created
     within MythTV

  +o  MythWeather

  +o  MythWeb, which allows you to control your MythTV system using a web
     browser.  With MythWeb, you can schedule and delete recordings,
     change keybindings and more.  With proper security, you may even
     schedule a program over the Internet and have it immediately acted
     on by the Master backend.

  [1m1.2.  QuickStart[0m

  Custom mini-distributions are available to make it easier to install
  MythTV.  A mini-distribution removes many of the "general purpose"
  workstation / server software packages that may be installed by
  default if you use one of the big-name OS packages.

  See http://mysettopbox.tv <http://mysettopbox.tv> if you'd like to
  install a custom version of Knoppix optimized for MythTV.

  See http://www.minimyth.org <http://www.minimyth.org> if you'd like to
  install MythTV onto a diskless system.

  See http://bit.blkbk.com <http://bit.blkbk.com> if you'd like to
  install MythTV on a Xbox.  [1mNOTE[22m:  Site appears unmaintained.

  See http://wilsonet.com/mythtv/ <http://wilsonet.com/mythtv/> for
  instructions tailored to RedHat's Fedora Core distribution.

  See http://www.mythbuntu.org <http://www.mythbuntu.org> if you'd like
  to install a customized version of Ubuntu optimized for MythTV.

  There is a MythTV wiki at http://wiki.mythtv.org
  <http://wiki.mythtv.org>.

  If you are installing this version for Schedules Direct support,
  please see the ``Migrating from DataDirect Labs to Schedules Direct''
  section for additional information.


  [1m1.3.  Upgrading from previous versions[0m

  The upgrade from previous versions should be transparent.  Any changes
  to the database structure should be applied automatically.

  It is [4mstrongly[24m recommended that you back up your database before
  installing a new version of MythTV.

  See ``Saving or Restoring the database'' for instructions.

  [1m1.8.  IRC[0m

  There are two IRC channels dedicated to MythTV which can be found on
  irc.freenode.net

  +o  mythtv

  +o  mythtv-users

  The mythtv channel is where the developers discuss code.  It is [4mnot[24m a
  user-support channel.  Please don't ask non-development related
  questions there.



  Really.  Even if there's no one in the mythtv-users IRC group or everyone
  seems to be ignoring you.


  [1m1.9.  Bug database[0m

  If you feel you need to contribute to a bug database, use the MythTV
  bug ticketing system at http://svn.mythtv.org/trac
  <http://svn.mythtv.org/trac>.

  Good entries will contain the following:

  1. Qt version

  2. Linux distribution

  3. gcc version

  4. the last entry in config.log to detail how you compiled

  5. MythTV version numbers ([4me.g.[24mfrom mythfrontend --version)

  6. Hardware

  7. How you are able to reproduce the bug

  See the instructions on how to debug in ``Section 22''.

  The bug database is not a chat room, so restrict your entries to what
  is relevant.  It's also not a repository of feature requests; a
  feature request without an accompanying patch file to implement that
  feature will be quickly closed.  There is a feature wishlist on the
  wiki at http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/index.php/Feature_Wishlist
  <http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/index.php/Feature_Wishlist>.  There is no
  guarantee that anything on the wishlist will ever get code written to
  implement it.

  If a developer closes out your bug, it's likely you didn't provide
  enough information.  Don't re-open a bug without providing additional
  information.

  [1m2.  Introduction.[0m

  This HOWTO document will focus on manually building MythTV in a North
  American environment. If you have installation instructions for a
  different region or Linux distribution, please send them to the author
  so that it can be included in other versions of this document.


  [1m3.  Checking prerequisites.[0m

  You must ensure that any firewalls (either hardware, or a software
  firewall installed by your distribution) will not block access to the
  ports that will be used by the MythTV clients and servers on the
  "inside" LAN.  The ports for MySQL (TCP port 3306) and mythbackend
  (TCP ports 6543 and 6544) must be open.  It is [4mstrongly[24m recommended
  that you do [4mnot[24m expose the MythTV and MySQL ports to the Internet or
  your "Outside" LAN.


  [1m3.1.  Hardware[0m

  Hardware selection is a complex topic, one this HOWTO will only
  discuss briefly and in general terms. The following subsections offer
  some general guidance but stop short of offering specific
  recommendations.

  For a good MythTV experience, you must understand that MythTV
  exercises your hardware more than a typical desktop. Encoder cards
  generate DMA across the PCI bus.  The CPU is busy encoding / decoding
  video. Hard drives are constantly reading and writing data. Building a
  MythTV system on older / "spare" hardware may be an exercise in
  frustration and can waste many hours of valuable time.

  For more detail about actual configurations that others have used,
  Mark Cooper has setup a hardware database at
  http://pvrhw.goldfish.org/ <http://pvrhw.goldfish.org/>. The website
  will let you browse what other users have reported as their hardware
  configuration, and how happy they are with the results.

  If you have specific questions about the suitability of specific
  hardware choices, you can consult the archives of the mythtv-users
  mailing list at http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/mythtv/
  <http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/mythtv/> or post a question to
  the list.

  [1m3.1.1.  CPU Type and Speed[0m

  Selection of CPU type and speed is one of the trickiest elements of
  hardware selection, mainly because there are so many tradeoffs which
  can be made.  For example, if you have plenty of CPU, you can use
  higher bitrates or capture sizes, etc.

  MythTV has two modes of operation.  First, it can function as a
  software video encoder, which means that it uses a fairly generic
  "dumb" video capture card to get frames of video, encodes them using
  the CPU on your motherboard and writes them to disk.  High-end video
  capture cards and devices like the TiVo and ReplayTV have dedicated
  encoder chips which use specialized hardware to convert the video
  stream to the MPEG-2 format without using the motherboard CPU.  The
  main CPU has the responsibility of running the Operating System and
  reading and writing the encoded frames to the disk.  These tasks have
  fairly low CPU requirements compared to encoding video, which is why a
  device like a Series 1 TiVo can run with only 16MB of RAM and a 54MHz
  CPU.

  There are many variables that go into the question: "How fast a CPU do
  I need to run MythTV"?  Obviously, the faster your CPU, the better
  your experience will be with MythTV.  If you are using the software
  MPEG-4 encoder and performing the "Watch TV" function, where the CPU
  is both encoding and decoding video simultaneously to allow Pause,
  Fast Forward and Rewind functions for live TV requires more CPU then
  just encoding or decoding.  MythTV also supports multiple encoder
  cards in a single PC, thereby increasing the CPU requirements if you
  plan on simultaneously encoding multiple programs.  As a general
  guideline, plan on 1GHz per encoder if you are doing software-based
  encoding, less if you are using a hardware-based encoder.

  Here are a few data points:

  +o  A PIII/733MHz system can encode one video stream using the MPEG-4
     codec using 480x480 capture resolution.  This does not allow for
     live TV watching, but does allow for encoding video and then
     watching it later.

  +o  A developer states that his AMD1800+ system can [1malmost [22mencode two
     MPEG-4 video streams and watch one program simultaneously.

  +o  A PIII/800MHz system with 512MB RAM can encode one video stream
     using the RTjpeg codec with 480x480 capture resolution and play it
     back simultaneously, thereby allowing live TV watching.

  +o  A dual Celeron/450MHz is able to view a 480x480 MPEG-4/3300kbps
     file created on a different system with 30% CPU usage.

  +o  A P4 2.4GHz machine can encode two 3300Kbps 480x480 MPEG-4 files
     and simultaneously serve content to a remote frontend.

  The second mode of operation is where MythTV is paired with a
  hardware-based video encoder, such as a Matrox G200 or a Hauppauge
  WinTV-PVR-150/250/350/500.  In this mode, because the video encoding
  is being done by a dedicated video processor, the host CPU
  requirements are quite low.  See the ``Video Capture Device'' section
  for details.

  The price differential between a frame grabber and a card that
  implements hardware MPEG-2 encoding, such as the Hauppauge PVR-x50
  series, is now less than $30 US.  Primary development in MythTV has
  transitioned to supporting MPEG-2 capture devices and HDTV, so if
  given the option, go with the hardware MPEG-2 encoder.

  If you have a Via M10000 series or a Hauppauge PVR-350, MythTV can use
  the hardware-based video decoder for playback, which further reduces
  CPU requirements.


  [1m3.1.2.  Memory[0m

  A MythTV host that is both a backend and a frontend and using software
  encoding with a single capture card should run adequately in 256MB of
  RAM.  Additional RAM above 256MB will not necessarily increase
  performance, but may be useful if you are running multiple encoders.


  [1m3.1.3.  Hard Disk(s)[0m

  Encoded video takes up a lot of hard disk space. The exact amount
  depends on the encoding scheme, the size of the raw images and the
  frames per second, but typical values for MythTV range from 700
  megabytes/hour for MPEG-4, 2 GB/hour for MPEG-2 and RTjpeg and 7
  GB/hour for ATSC HDTV.



         [1mNOTE[22m:  You [4mmust[24m use DMA for hard drive access to prevent
  choppy or jittery video.  Not all distributions enable DMA at boot
  time. See the Troubleshooting Section for ``instructions'' on how to
  do this.

  Writing video to disk is sensitive to timing issues; RTjpeg requires
  less CPU with the tradeoff being larger files and needing to write to
  the disk faster.  MPEG-4 requires more CPU, but the files are smaller.
  At the default resolution, MPEG-2 creates the largest files of all
  with almost no CPU impact.

  See the Troubleshooting ``section'' for more information.


  [1m3.1.4.  Filesystems[0m

  MythTV creates large files, many in excess of 4GB.  You [4mmust[24m use a 64
  or 128 bit filesystem. These will allow you to create large files.
  Filesystems known to have problems with large files are FAT (all
  versions), and ReiserFS (versions 3 and 4).

  Because MythTV creates very large files, a filesystem that does well
  at deleting large files is important.  Numerous benchmarks show that
  XFS and JFS do very well at this task.  You are [4mstrongly[24m encouraged to
  consider one of these for your MythTV filesystem.  JFS is the absolute
  best at deletion, so you may want to try it if XFS gives you problems.
  MythTV .21 incorporates a "slow delete" feature, which progressively
  shrinks the file rather than attempting to delete it all at once, so
  if you're more comfortable with a filesystem such as ext3 (whose
  delete performance for large files isn't that good) you may use it
  rather than one of the known-good high-performance file systems.
  There are other ramifications to using XFS and JFS - neither offer the
  opportunity to shrink a filesystem; they may only be expanded.



                 [1mNOTE[22m:  You [4mmust[24m [4mnot[24m use ReiserFS v3 for
  your recordings. You will get corrupted recordings if you do.

  Because of the size of the MythTV files, it may be useful to plan for
  future expansion right from the beginning.  If your case and power
  supply have the capacity for additional hard drives, read through the
  ``LVM'' and ``Advanced Partition Formatting'' sections for some
  pointers.


  [1m3.1.5.  Video Capture Device[0m

  In order to capture video, MythTV will need one or more video capture
  devices with Linux drivers.  There are a number of classes of hardware
  available for capturing video.

  [1m3.1.5.1.  Frame Grabbers.[0m

  This class of card is the simplest and is usually the cheapest.  There
  is no on-board encoding of the analog video; hardware known as a
  Digital-Analog Converter (DAC) takes the video and presents it to the
  computer in an essentially raw digital form.

  For a list of video capture cards known to work with Linux, please see
  /usr/src/linux/Documentation/video4linux/bttv for a partial listing;
  even if your specific card is not listed, it may be that the vendor is
  actually using a standard reference design and placing their own name
  on it.  See the video4linux mailing list
  (https://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/video4linux-list
  <https://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/video4linux-list>) for
  more information and for specific hardware questions.

  The most common inexpensive cards available use the Bt848, Bt878 or
  CX2388x series of video capture chips; examples are the "Hauppauge
  WinTV Go" card and the "AverTV Desktop PVR" card, both of which use
  the bttv kernel module.


  ______________________________________________________________________
  NOTE:  The ATI TV Wonder series and the ATI All-in-Wonder series of cards
  are not the same.  The All-in-Wonder cards will not work with MythTV.
  ______________________________________________________________________



        [1mNOTE[22m: The ATI All-in-Wonder cards (which are not the same
  as the ATI TV Wonder, TV Wonder VE or TV Wonder Pro) [4mwill[24m [4mnot[24m work as
  a MythTV capture device because the GATOS http://gatos.sourceforge.net
  <http://gatos.sourceforge.net> drivers that are available provide only
  a limited subset of the V4L API. The TV Wonder series of cards are
  supported by the Bt8x8 Video4Linux driver.

  After you have installed a suitable capture device, you can check that
  the kernel sees it with lspci. Look for an entry labeled "Multimedia
  video controller". To get more detailed information about the card,
  use lspci -v or lspci -vv.  Ensure that your system is loading the
  bttv modules by typing:


       # lsmod |grep bttv



  You want to see the bttv module listed.

  [1m3.1.5.2.  Hardware MPEG-2 encoders.[0m

  While inexpensive video-capture cards simply capture raw frames,
  leaving encoding to software, some higher-end cards incorporate
  hardware-based encoding. Using either a G200 MJPEG encoder card, or a
  MPEG-2 encoder card supported by the IvyTV project
  http://ivtvdriver.org <http://ivtvdriver.org/> such as the Hauppauge
  PVR-150/250/350/500, Avermedia M179, Hauppauge "Freestyle" or Yuan
  M600 cards will allow you to use dedicated hardware encoders rather
  than your CPU. (The PVR-350 can simultaneously be used as an output
  device.) Using the on-board MPEG-2 encoder greatly reduces the CPU
  requirements for encoding.

  The ivtv driver was incorporated into the Linux kernel starting at
  v2.6.22.

  There is a Beta driver for the HVR-1600 card at
  http://www.ivtvdriver.org/index.php/Cx18
  <http://www.ivtvdriver.org/index.php/Cx18>

  [1mNOTE[22m:  Motherboards with the Via chipset are notoriously bad with DMA
  and have caused numerous issues with ivtv, including hard locks.  See
  the ivtv website http://ivtvdriver.org <http://ivtvdriver.org> for the
  latest information on what works and what doesn't.

  Here are some data points for encoding:

  +o  A Celeron 450 uses 2% CPU for encoding a 480x480 16Mbps MPEG-2
     stream.

  Here are some data points for decoding:


  +o  An Athlon 1800XP can decode a 720x480 8Mbps MPEG-2 file using 10%
     CPU

  +o  An Athlon 1GHz can decode a 720x480 16Mbps MPEG-2 file using 30-50%
     CPU, can decode a 480x480 16Mbps MPEG-2 using 30% CPU and
     approximately 30% for Live TV at 416x480.

  +o  A P3-550 can decode a 480x480 16Mbps MPEG-2 file with 55% CPU.

  +o  A Celeron 450 (no SSE) can decode a 480x480 16Mbps MPEG-2 file with
     80% CPU.


  [1m3.1.5.3.  DVB capture cards.[0m

  DVB is a video standard primarily found in Europe (where it comes in
  DVB-C, DVB-T and DVB-S varieties for Cable, Terrestrial and Satellite)
  and is also used as the programming interface for HDTV capture cards
  in Linux.  To see if your DVB card is supported, see the list of cards
  in the "Supported Hardware" section of the DVB Wiki at
  http://www.linuxtv.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page
  <http://www.linuxtv.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page> for more
  information.

  In the United States, you may use a card such as the TwinHan to obtain
  unencrypted Free-To-Air satellite channels.  See
  http://www.lyngsat.com/ <http://www.lyngsat.com/> for the types of
  content which is available.


  [1m3.1.5.4.  HDTV.[0m

  There are a number of HDTV cards with Linux drivers which are known to
  operate in the United States; a complete list of cards with DVB
  drivers can be found at
  http://www.linuxtv.org/wiki/index.php/ATSC_Devices
  <http://www.linuxtv.org/wiki/index.php/ATSC_Devices> Some cards
  support capture of unencrypted digital cable TV (utilizing QAM256),
  others will only work with Over The Air (aka "OTA") signals captured
  with an antenna (with 8VSB).

  Cards that have been reported to work include:

  +o  pcHDTV HD-2000, Air2PC PCI rev 1-3 (8VSB only)

  +o  SiliconDust HDHomeRun           (8VSB, QAM256)

  +o  pcHDTV HD-3000/5500             (8VSB, QAM256)

  +o  Air2PC HD-5000                  (8VSB, QAM256)

  +o  DViCO Fusion HDTV Lite/Gold 5   (8VSB, QAM256)

  [1mNOTE[22m: There are no known consumer-level capture devices which will
  allow you to capture the HDTV output (DVI, HDMI, VGA, YPbPr /
  Component) from a set-top box commonly found with digital cable
  systems or satellite systems. [4mNone[24m of the capture devices listed above
  perform any encoding; they merely allow your computer to save a copy
  of a HDTV stream which has already been converted to MPEG-2 at the
  broadcast facility.

  [1mNOTE:[22m: All of the cards listed above (except for the HD-2000 and
  HDHomeRun) should be configured as DVB cards. The HD-2000 can be
  configured as a pcHDTV card if you use the V4L drivers from
  http://www.pchdtv.com <http://www.pchdtv.com> and use Linux kernel
  2.6.9 or earlier.  With kernel 2.6.10 and higher it must be configured
  as a DVB card, but you lose access to the second antenna input in ATSC
  mode. The HDHomeRun should be configured as two HDHomeRun cards, one
  for each tuner.

  To playback HDTV content, plan on a powerful CPU.  "How powerful?"
  depends on a number of factors, such as the capture resolution,
  whether the video is progressive or interlaced, and whether your
  display card has hardware-assist support for Linux.

  The Simple Answer: Once you are in the 3.2 Ghz P4-class of CPU you
  should have no issues with viewing HDTV.


  The Complicated Answer:

  For 720p content (1280x720), a 2.4GHz P4 should be sufficient.

  For 1920x1080i->1920x1080p with the better deinterlacing methods done
  in real time a 2.4GHz CPU is taxed, but should work if you use "Bob
  and Weave" deinterlacing, or if you have an NVIDIA card with MPEG-2
  hardware acceleration.  If you enable the hardware acceleration, you
  may be able to use a 1.8GHz processor.


  [1m3.1.5.5.  Firewire.[0m

  You may use the Firewire output of the Motorola DCT6200 or the SA3250.
  If your provider uses 5C encryption on a particular channel, you won't
  be able to get any content.


  [1m3.1.5.6.  DBoxII or other devices running Neutrino[0m

  You may use the Ethernet port of an DBoxII or a similar device to
  capture MPEG2. Your set top box has to be running the Neutrino GUI.


  [1m3.1.5.7.  USB Capture Devices.[0m

  The Plextor ConvertX PVR devices are supported through Linux drivers
  available from http://www.plextor.com/english/support/LinuxSDK.htm
  <http://www.plextor.com/english/support/LinuxSDK.htm>. MythTV uses the
  Plextor to capture hardware encoded MPEG-4, so the host CPU
  requirements are low.

  Hauppauge WinTV-PVR-USB2 (driver available at
  http://www.isely.net/pvrusb2/ <http://www.isely.net/pvrusb2/>)
  emulates a PVR-x50 card.


  [1m3.1.5.8.  IP Recorder (RTSP, RTS, UDP)[0m

  MPEG-2, MPEG-4 and H.264 internet TS stream recording is supported
  using the IPTV recorder in MythTV. This recorder expects the channels
  to be supplied as a m3u playlist. If your DSL/Fiber provider supplies
  television service, but does not provide a m3u playlist for the
  channels, you can construct one for your own use. You do not need to
  download it from the same server as the streams themselves, and can
  also read it from a file if this is more convenient.

  [1mNOTE[22m: Some DSL providers only allow you to use one recorder at a time,
  so you may need to limit yourself to one recorder in MythTV and turn
  off any set top box the cable provider sold or rented to you with your
  service. This limitation is independent of the bandwidth you have
  purchased.


  [1m3.1.6.  Hardware known NOT to work and other issues[0m


  +o  Hauppauge WinTV-D or -HD (no driver)

  +o  Hauppauge WinTV-USB series

  +o  Hauppauge WinTV-PVR-usb (model 602), or WinTV-PVR-PCI (model 880)
     cards (no driver - this is not the PVR-250/350 series of cards
     supported by the IvyTV driver)


  +o  ATI All-in-Wonder series


  [1m3.1.7.  Sound card[0m

  The system needs a sound card or an on-board equivalent on the
  motherboard to play back and in most cases, to record sound. Any sound
  card that can be operated by the ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound
  Architecture) kernel modules will work with MythTV.  However, some
  cards and drivers will provide better quality or compatibility than
  others.  In particular, many audio devices included on motherboards
  can be problematic.

  The usual practice for capturing the audio associated with the video
  is to run a cable from an audio output on the video capture card to
  the Line input on a sound card. However, some video capture cards
  provide on-board audio capabilities that work with the kernel btaudio
  module instead, thereby eliminating the need for a cable.  This is
  useful if you will be using multiple capture cards in a single
  chassis, since each capture card will not need its own sound card.
  Note that a separate sound card is still required for playback when
  using btaudio, and that often the audio recorded in this way will be
  mono only.  See the ``btaudio'' section for more information.



        [1mNOTE[22m:  Analog video capture cards are the only ones which
  require a soundcard for capturing audio.  DVB, HDTV, and other
  hardware encoder cards all provide a combined audio / video stream.



        [1mNOTE[22m:  Plugging a Line-level device into the Mic input is
  not recommended.  Line-level devices have higher voltages and can
  damage the sound card.  In addition, even if it doesn't break your
  card, you will be getting Mono sound.  See the Linux MP3 HOWTO at
  http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/MP3-HOWTO.html
  <http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/MP3-HOWTO.html> for additional information.


  [1m3.1.8.  Video Display Card[0m

  MythTV will work with just about any video card.  However, it is
  highly recommended that you use a card which supports XVideo (XV)
  extensions. If your card does not support XV, color conversion and
  scaling will be performed by your CPU rather than the video card.
  This is very CPU and memory intensive and will often result in dropped
  frames and a corresponding degradation of quality.  Check the X
  documentation for details if you are uncertain about your preferred
  card.  You may also run xvinfo; look for your video card to be listed
  as one of the adapters.


  If you want to use MythTV with a standard television, you will need a
  physical connection from your video card to your TV set, which can
  either be a TV-out port on the card itself or an external adapter that
  converts the VGA signal to an appropriate video signal. "Appropriate"
  depends on a number of factors, such as video standard (NTSC vs. PAL),
  the type of input connection (Composite vs. SVideo), etc.

  Note that with some video cards and X drivers, XVideo extensions are
  only supported on the VGA output, and not on the TV output.


  [1m3.1.9.  Cards with TV-out[0m

  The next section deals with a number of cards that are known to have
  TV-out ports.  The list is unlikely to be complete, so if you know of
  others, please post a message to the mythtv-users mailing list so the
  information can be included in future versions of the HOWTO. The list
  is organized by manufacturer.

  Reports here are based on what users of the cards have posted on the
  mythtv-users mailing list, so if you need configuration details,
  please search the archives at http://www.gossamer-
  threads.com/lists/mythtv/ <http://www.gossamer-
  threads.com/lists/mythtv/> using the card name in your search string.


  [1m3.1.9.1.  ATI[0m

  ATI makes many cards with TV-out capability, but only offers Linux
  drivers for Radeon 8500 and above cards.  See the Drivers and Software
  section of http://www.ati.com <http://www.ati.com/> for the driver and
  additional information.

  The enhanced ati.2 X driver created by the GATOS
  http://gatos.sourceforge.net <http://gatos.sourceforge.net> project
  offers some support for TV-out on other ATI cards, but only in its
  "experimental" version, available through CVS. There have been reports
  from people who say they have made this driver work with one or
  another ATI card.  For example, Bruce Markey  <mailto:bjm@lvcm.com>
  writes (on the mythtv-users mailing list): "I got this to work. You
  can quote me on that.  I've used TV-out on several models of ATI cards
  both All-In-Wonder and regular cards with TV-out." See the
  "Adventurous Setup" section of
  http://gatos.sourceforge.net/watching_tv.php
  <http://gatos.sourceforge.net/watching_tv.php> for details. Also see
  http://www.retinalburn.net/linux/tvout.html
  <http://www.retinalburn.net/linux/tvout.html> for more information.


  [1m3.1.9.2.  NVIDIA[0m

  Some NVIDIA cards with TV-out can be run using the standard nv driver
  in X, combined with the userspace application [1mnvtv [22mto control the TV-
  out port. See http://sourceforge.net/projects/nv-tv-out/
  <http://sourceforge.net/projects/nv-tv-out/> for details.  Recent
  versions of the NVIDIA driver have better support for overscan and
  other features useful with TV-Out, so the [1mnvtv [22mapplication may not be
  required.

  Some NVIDIA cards can be run with a proprietary NVIDIA X driver made
  available by NVIDIA. See http://www.nvidia.com/object/unix.html
  <http://www.nvidia.com/object/unix.html> for more information.

  [1mNOTE[22m:  It's strongly recommended that you use the proprietary NVIDIA
  drivers; they have excellent support for XvMC and ship with a good
  configuration utility.  XvMC provides MPEG-2 hardware acceleration,
  which is important if you want to display HDTV.


  [1m3.1.9.3.  Hauppauge PVR-350[0m

  MythTV supports the TV-out and MPEG-2 decoder functions in the IvyTV
  driver.
  The PVR-350 is unique amongst the Hauppauge PVR-x50 cards in that it
  also supports audio output, but you need to connect that audio output
  to something.  There are two courses of action you may take:

  1. Take the audio output from the PVR-350 and plug it into an input on
     a sound card on your machine.  You may then use MythTV's internal
     audio controls.

  2. Take the audio output from the PVR-350 and connect it directly to
     your television / audio system.  You must indicate that you are
     using external audio control on the PVR-350 setup page.


  [1m3.1.9.4.  Other Options[0m

  Some devices with on-board TV-out capability, such as Xboxes converted
  to Linux and some laptops can be used as MythTV frontends to display
  on a television screen. Please consult the mythtv-users mailing list
  for messages that report the details of these special arrangements.


  [1m3.1.10.  External Adapters[0m

  External adapters convert standard VGA output to a form suitable for
  display on a television. The output format varies by region, since
  different countries have different TV standards. People on the mythtv-
  users list have mentioned these adapters:


  +o  AITech Web Cable Plus, powered by external transformer or takes
     power from PS/2 keyboard connector, support resolutions up to
     1024x768, outputs composite and SVideo, provides position
     adjustment.

  +o  Averkey lite, powered by a USB port, has Composite, SVideo, YPbPr
     outputs; pan, brightness, overscan/underscan controls; supports up
     to 1024x768 outputs; and supports PAL and NTSC.

  +o  ADS TV Elite XGA

  +o  AverKey iMicro (comments are generally favorable)

  +o  AITech Web Cable (comments are generally unfavorable, different
     than the "Plus" version above)

  +o  TVIEW Gold (mentioned once, favorably)


  [1m3.2.  Software[0m

  There are a few ways of installing programs on Linux systems; you can
  either use a pre-compiled package, or install from a tarball after
  satisfying any prerequisites.



      [1mNOTE[22m: you must have the MySQL database software installed on a
  system to store the master database.  This does not necessarily mean
  that MySQL must run on one of the MythTV boxes.  The minimum MySQL
  version is 5.0.



  [1m3.2.1.  Pre-compiled packages[0m

  A number of people have created pre-compiled packages for MythTV that
  may make your installation easier.



          [1mBIG FAT WARNING[22m:  This HOWTO assumes that you have [4mnot[0m
  installed MythTV from a package.  All example command lines and file
  locations are based on the MythTV tarball defaults.  Some packagers
  have modified the filenames, binaries and file locations to match what
  is commonly found in that distribution.  Any issues with MythTV
  installed via a pre-compiled package [1mMUST [22mbe raised with the packager.

  If you use any of the pre-compiled packages you may not need to
  perform any additional configuration steps in this HOWTO.  The next
  logical step is ``configuring MySQL'', which you may or may not have
  to perform.  See your package documentation.


  [1m3.2.1.1.  Red Hat Linux / Fedora Core[0m

  The definitive documentation on installing MythTV on Red Hat Linux /
  Fedora Core can be found in Jarod Wilson's (mailto:jcw@wilsonet.com
  <mailto:jcw@wilsonet.com>) HOWTO at http://wilsonet.com/mythtv/
  <http://wilsonet.com/mythtv/> Just like 3rd-party packages, any 3rd-
  party documentation problems should be brought up with the 3rd-parties
  (maintainer, lists, bugzillas etc.).  The installation instructions
  which follow should be used as a guide only; refer to Jarod's guide.

  Red Hat Linux and Fedora Core packages for MythTV and all of its add-
  on modules and some themes have been packaged by
  mailto:Axel.Thimm@ATrpms.net <mailto:Axel.Thimm@ATrpms.net> and are
  available at http://ATrpms.net/topic/multimedia/
  <http://ATrpms.net/topic/multimedia/>. All of the prerequisites for
  MythTV (such as XMLTV) are available as RPM packages. If you have
  problems with the RPMs, please contact the ATrpms lists at
  http://lists.ATrpms.net/ <http://lists.ATrpms.net/> or file a bug
  against http://bugzilla.ATrpms.net/ <http://bugzilla.ATrpms.net/>.

  Given the large number of dependent RPMs you are advised to use tools
  like apt or yum for automatic retrieval and installation of the
  required RPMs.  (http://ATrpms.net/install.html
  <http://ATrpms.net/install.html>) In this case a special meta-package
  called mythtv-suite will allow you to install all of MythTV and its
  add-ons, plus all dependencies.

  If you don't have [1mapt [22mor [1myum [22mon your machine, download and install the
  atrpms-kickstart package from http://ATrpms.net/name/atrpms-kickstart/
  <http://ATrpms.net/name/atrpms-kickstart/>.  Install the package with:


       # rpm -Uvh atrpms-kickstart*



  Then run:



  # apt-get update
  # apt-get dist-upgrade
  # apt-get update



  And finally:


       # apt-get install mythtv-suite



  These steps however, do NOT perform the installation of any drivers
  required for [1mALSA[22m, capture cards, [1mlirc kernel modules[22m, etc., nor do
  they set up your MythTV database. Check http://ATrpms.net/topic/multi-
  media/ <http://ATrpms.net/topic/multimedia/> for the drivers you need.


  [1m3.2.1.2.  Mandriva[0m

  Thac has created RPMs for MythTV for Mandriva which may be obtained
  from http://rpm.nyvalls.se/ <http://rpm.nyvalls.se/> If you have
  problems with the RPMs, please send him email directly at
  thac@nyvalls.se <thac@nyvalls.se>.

  [1m3.2.1.3.  Debian[0m

  Debian packages for MythTV and most of its add-on modules are
  maintained by Christian Marillat mailto:marillat@free.fr
  <mailto:marillat@free.fr> and are available at http://www.debian-
  multimedia.org/ <http://www.debian-multimedia.org/>.  Installation
  instructions can be found on those pages as well. All of the
  prerequisites for MythTV are available as Debian packages, most of
  them from the official Debian archive.

  If you have followed the instructions on the above page you should
  have added


       deb-src http://www.debian-multimedia.org sid main



  to your /etc/apt/sources.list file.  Running [1mapt-get update [22mand then
  executing [1mapt-get build-dep mythtv [22mshould install all the pre-
  requisites required to compile MythTV.



   [1mNOTE[22m:  Due to the requirement for Qt 3.3+, there are no packages for
  Debian woody/stable.


  The Debian packages are configured such that MythTV programs should be
  run as the mythtv user, which is automatically created during
  installation.  This user has access to write new recordings to disk in
  the default directory, read and write the database, access the audio
  and video devices, and everything else that MythTV needs to do.

  See /usr/share/doc/[4mpackagename[24m/README.Debian for more information,
  including copies of the MythTV documentation.  The mythtv-doc package
  contains a copy of this HOWTO in /usr/share/doc/mythtv-doc.

  [1m3.2.2.  Manual installation[0m

  You may use the graphical tools that come with your distribution, or
  you can use command-line utilities.  Either system will get the job
  done, and it all depends on your comfort level with Linux.

  In order to compile MythTV, we need to make sure that the software it
  needs is installed.  This list includes [1mmysql[22m, [1mgcc[22m, [1mfreetype2-devel[22m,
  [1mxorg-xserver-devel[22m, [1mqt-devel [22mand [1mlame[22m.  If you're going to use a
  remote control with MythTV, you're going to need the [1mcdialog [22mpackage
  in order to compile [1mlircd [22mif your distribution doesn't have a pre-
  packaged [1mlirc[22m.  If you are using [1mXMLTV [22mas a grabber, you will need
  [1mperl[22m.


  ______________________________________________________________________
  NOTE:  Qt v3.3 or higher is required.

  NOTE:  MythTV DOES NOT WORK with Qt4.

  NOTE:  If you are going to be using RPMs to install various
  components, you should be aware that not all packages include the necessary
  headers for compiling.  If you're having trouble compiling, ensure
  that you've installed the -devel version of a prerequisite.
  ______________________________________________________________________



  [1m3.2.3.  Command-line installation[0m

  This section details the various methods for installing prerequisites
  from the command line.


  [1m3.2.3.1.  Mandriva[0m

  [1mNOTE[22m:  The following instructions should be considered out of date as
  of 2006-09-10.  If updated instructions are not submitted by the
  release of v0.21 of MythTV they will be removed.

  [1murpmi [22mis the simplest tool for installation of packages from the
  command line, but properly configuring it can be difficult.  The
  following website http://easyurpmi.zarb.org/
  <http://easyurpmi.zarb.org/> will allow you to choose a mirror site
  and then present the command-line configuration text for that mirror.
  You will most likely need to add a "Contrib" mirror to your setup.  If
  you add a site from the "Penguin Liberation Front", you will be able
  to load the lame library without compiling from source.

  Open a shell, and execute the following. You may get asked a number of
  questions regarding dependencies.  It's best to answer "YES".


       $ su
       # urpmi mysql gcc gcc-c++ freetype2-devel cdialog alsa-utils
       # urpmi XFree86-devel perl
       # urpmi libqt3-devel libMesaGLU1-devel



  ______________________________________________________________________
  NOTE for Mandriva 9.1+ users: execute the following command.

  # urpmi libqt3-mysql
  ______________________________________________________________________


  However, you might get this when you execute the commands above:


       everything already installed



  In that case, you're ready to move to the next ``section''.  Once you
  have completed installing the pre-requisites, exit out of the shell
  and start a new one to ensure that any environment variables setup by
  the installation have a chance to take effect.


  [1m3.2.3.2.  Gentoo.[0m

  [1mNOTE[22m:  MythTV does [4mnot[24m run on Qt4.  If Qt has not been installed on
  your system: Edit /etc/make.conf and locate the "USE" variable. If the
  line is commented out, remove the comment. The line should have at
  least:


       USE="mysql alsa"



  Next you need to build Qt. If you don't plan on using the ebuilds as
  described in the Gentoo section then you also need to install lame.


       # emerge lame mysql qt



  If you have already installed Qt: you will need to rebuild because the
  default installation doesn't include MySQL support, a requirement for
  MythTV.  To enable SQL support, add "mysql" to your USE variable in
  /etc/make.conf and rebuild Qt by running


       # emerge qt



  All the necessary files will be downloaded and built. Even on a fast
  machine this may take a lot of time if you need to do a full Qt build.


  [1m3.2.3.3.  Debian.[0m

  Build-dependencies for MythTV can be satisfied by adding the following
  to your /etc/apt/sources.list



  # Christian Marillat's packages (mplayer, lame)
  deb http://www.debian-multimedia.org sid main
  deb-src http://www.debian-multimedia.org sid main



  and executing:


       # apt-get build-dep mythtv
       # apt-get source mythtv --compile



  [1m4.  System Configuration Requirements for Compiling MythTV.[0m

  Before you compile MythTV from the current source tarball or from
  [1msubversion[22m, you may need to modify your system configuration in a few
  ways.

  In general, if you install MythTV from pre-packaged binaries for your
  Linux distribution/version, you don't need to be too concerned about
  the issues in this section of the HOWTO - the install script for the
  packages should take care of them. However, this section is still
  recommended reading which may help if the packager skipped a step in
  their packaging.


  [1m4.1.  Software requirements for compiling MythTV[0m

  [1m4.1.1.  General requirements[0m

  MythTV is written in C++ and requires a fairly complete, but standard,
  compilation environment, including a recent g++ compiler, make, and
  appropriate header files for shared libraries. Any standard Linux
  distribution should be able to install a suitable compilation
  environment from its packaging system. Section 3.2 of this HOWTO
  provides some details of how to install the required environment for
  many distributions.

  Subsequent sections of this chapter address the few oddities that you
  may have to adjust by hand before you compile MythTV.

  The reference compilation system for MythTV is Ubuntu.


  [1m4.2.  Shared-Library requirements for MythTV[0m

  [1m4.2.1.  Modifying /etc/ld.so.conf[0m

  The runtime manager for shared libraries, [1m/lib/ld.so[22m, gets information
  about the locations and contents of shared libraries from
  /etc/ld.so.cache, a file created by [1mldconfig [22mfrom information in
  /etc/ld.so.conf.  Because MythTV installs some shared libraries in
  /usr/local/lib, that directory needs to be added to the list of
  directories for [1mld.so [22mto search when doing runtime linking of
  programs, if it is not already there.  You do this, as root, by
  editing /etc/ld.so.conf, then running [1mldconfig[22m. There are many ways to
  do this; one that works is to enter this series of commands:



  $ su -
  # echo /usr/local/lib >> /etc/ld.so.conf
  # /sbin/ldconfig
  # exit
  $



  [1m4.3.  Environment variable requirements for MythTV[0m

  [1m4.3.1.  General requirements[0m

  [1m4.3.1.1.  QT libraries and binaries[0m

  The compiler needs to be able to locate QT binaries and libraries in
  order to compile MythTV. QTDIR needs to be set and the directory
  holding the QT binaries needs to be added to your PATH.  Your
  distribution may already be making these changes as a part of the
  installation of the software prerequisites detailed earlier.

  One way to do this is as follows:

  Open a shell and execute the following:


       $ echo $PATH
       /usr/local/bin:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin:/usr/games:/usr/lib/qt3/bin:/home/mythtv/bin:/usr/lib/qt3/bin
       $ echo $QTDIR
       /usr/lib/qt3
       $ which qmake
       /usr/lib/qt3/bin/qmake



  For Mandriva, you should see a value like /usr/lib/qt3 for QTDIR and
  /usr/lib/qt3/bin should be in $PATH.

  For Gentoo, you should see a value like /usr/qt/3 for QTDIR and
  /usr/qt/3/bin should be in $PATH.

  If you don't, do not proceed past this step until you have resolved
  this error. You may need to manually specify the QTDIR and PATH at the
  shell prompt before compiling.

  Also, check that there has been a link created in /usr/lib/qt3/mkspecs
  (/usr/share/qt3/mkspecs for Debian) called default. If not, you'll get
  errors during the compile. See the Troubleshooting Section for more
  information.

  [1m4.3.2.  Distribution-Specific Notes[0m

  [1m4.3.2.1.  Mandriva[0m

  The following instructions work for Mandriva using [1mbash [22mas the shell,
  and may be applicable for a distribution which uses /etc/profile.d.



          [1mNOTE[22m:  Mandriva 10 installs a /etc/profile.d/qtdir3.sh
  file, but it doesn't include the addition of the PATH variable.  If
  you're running Mandriva 10, don't create a mythtv.sh file as detailed
  below; edit the qtdir3.sh file and add the PATH statement within the
  if / fi block.  As root, create the following file in /etc/profile.d
  The example filename is "mythtv.sh". Use what you feel is appropriate.

  Open a shell, and switch to superuser mode.



            [1mNOTE[22m: ^D means press CTRL and d at the same time.


       $ su
       # cd /etc/profile.d
       cat > mythtv.sh
       export QTDIR=/usr/lib/qt3
       export PATH=$PATH:/usr/lib/qt3/bin
       ^D

       # chmod a+x mythtv.sh
       # exit
       $ exit



  The last two commands are to exit out of the shell. This way, when you
  next open a shell your new commands will take effect.


  [1m4.3.3.  Device Permissions[0m

  MythTV will need access to the video4linux devices on your system.  By
  default, your distribution may restrict access to these devices to the
  logged-in user, so if you will be automatically starting [1mmythbackend[0m
  from a script rather than an interactive terminal session you will
  need to make some adjustments.

  [1mNOTE[22m: The following instructions are accurate for Mandriva.

  Check for a file called /etc/security/console.perms.  Open the file in
  your favorite text editor and look for a line that has:


       <console>  0600 <v4l>        0600 root.video



  and replace it with


       <console>  0666 <v4l>        0666 root.video



  What we're doing is allowing read and write access to the files in the
  video4linux directory.

  [1m5.  Downloading and compiling.[0m

  Get MythTV from the http://www.mythtv.org <http://www.mythtv.org> web
  site.  There are two installation methods you may choose from.  The
  first is to download the latest release in tarball format and compile.
  The tarball release of MythTV should work on a wide variety of systems
  and should be the preferred method for new users.  If you wish to use
  the [1msubversion [22mcopy of MythTV you may obtain it from
  http://svn.mythtv.org <http://svn.mythtv.org>



               [1mNOTE[22m: If you are going to use [1msubversion [22mto
  compile MythTV rather than using the distribution tarball, you [4mmust[0m
  join the http://www.mythtv.org/mailman/listinfo/mythtv-commits/
  <http://www.mythtv.org/mailman/listinfo/mythtv-commits/> and
  http://www.mythtv.org/mailman/listinfo/mythtv-dev/
  <http://www.mythtv.org/mailman/listinfo/mythtv-dev/> mailing lists to
  keep up to date with the current status of the code.  Code obtained
  from subversion has no guarantees regarding stability, etc.

  If you are in North America you will use the Schedules Direct grabber
  which is built-in to MythTV.  You [4mdo[24m [4mnot[24m need to install XMLTV (so you
  may skip XMLTV-related instructions), but you need [1mwget [22mversion 1.9.1
  or higher.

  Get XMLTV from http://xmltv.sourceforge.net
  <http://xmltv.sourceforge.net>.  Download the latest version (0.5.51).


  ______________________________________________________________________
  NOTE for Mandriva users:  If you have added a "PLF" mirror, you may skip the
  next step and type:

  # urpmi libmp3lame0 libmp3lame0-devel

  After downloading, be sure to install both:
  # rpm -Uvh lame*
  ______________________________________________________________________



  Get lame from http://lame.sourceforge.net/
  <http://lame.sourceforge.net/>.  Download the source code to v3.96.1
  by following the links from "Using" through "Download...".


  [1m5.1.  Building LAME[0m

  Open a shell and switch to the directory where you saved lame.


       $ tar -xzf lame-3.96.1.tar.gz
       $ cd lame-3.96.1
       $ ./configure
       $ make
       $ make test
       $ su
       # make install



  Check that it worked:



  # ls -l /usr/local/lib

  # exit
  $



  [1m5.2.  XMLTV[0m

  [1m5.2.1.  Red Hat Linux and Fedora Core:[0m

  RPMs for [1mXMLTV [22mand all of its dependencies can be obtained from
  http://ATrpms.net/name/xmltv/ <http://ATrpms.net/name/xmltv/>. The web
  page has a list of all the dependent packages you must download and
  install.


       # rpm -Uvh xmltv* perl*



  If you install from this location you may skip to ``Manually building
  MythTV''.

  [1m5.2.2.  Mandriva[0m

  RPMs for [1mXMLTV [22mand all of its dependencies are located in Mandriva's
  "contrib".  If you have added a contrib mirror, try installing [1mXMLTV[22m:


       # urpmi xmltv xmltv-grabbers



  If this does not work, it is possible that contrib for your Mandriva
  version does not have [1mXMLTV[22m, so you may install the XMLTV prerequi-
  sites by typing:


       # urpmi perl-xml-twig perl-xml-writer perl-datemanip perl-libwww-perl



  and skip straight to the XMLTV compilation step.


  [1m5.2.3.  Manual installation[0m

  Untar the xmltv file:


       $ tar -xjf xmltv-0.5.51.tar.bz2

  Install the xmltv prerequisites.  The following prerequisites are the
  minimum required; when you actually start running the xmltv setup pro-
  gram it may alert you to other modules that are required.:



       $ su
       # perl -MCPAN -e shell
       cpan> install XML::Twig
       cpan> install Date::Manip
       Date::Manip is up to date.
       cpan> install LWP
       cpan> install XML::Writer
       cpan> exit



  Change to the XMLTV directory and compile it:


       $ cd xmltv-0.5.51
       $ perl Makefile.PL



  You can answer "N" to the tv_check, tv_pick_cgi questions.  Say "yes"
  to the grabber required for your location.

  You may get errors about modules not being installed.  You will need
  to resolve any missing dependencies at this point, or your grabber may
  not work correctly.


       $ make
       $ make test
       $ su
       # make install
       # exit

  to obtain the latest version of MythTV:



       $ mkdir mythtv
       $ svn co http://svn.mythtv.org/svn/trunk/ mythtv
       $ cd mythtv



  To use a release version, you can execute:


       $ mkdir mythtv-release-0.21
       $ svn co http://svn.mythtv.org/svn/branches/release-0-21-fixes/ mythtv-release-0.21
       $ cd mythtv-release-0.21



  [1mNOTE[22m:  Using a svn version of the code allows you to stay up-to-date
  with changes.  So, if there's an update to the 0.21 release and you
  originally obtained it using svn, you could enter the mythtv-
  release-0.21 directory and type "svn up", which will update your copy
  with the fixed version from the website.  You would then recompile and
  install the updated 0.21 code.

  If you are using the tarball, then unpack it:


       $ tar -xjf mythtv-0.21.tar.bz2
       $ cd mythtv-0.21
       $ ./configure



  If you wish to change options, run [1m./configure --help [22mto see what is
  available and to override and automatically detected options.  See the
  config.log file after running [1mconfigure [22mto see previous runs.

  To compile:


       $ make -j 2



  The MythTV compile can take advantage of multiple CPUs, SMP and
  Hyperthreading.  If you want to build MythTV on a multi-CPU machine
  (or with [1mdistcc[22m), specify "-j numjobs", where "numjobs" is greater
  than 2.  In the above example, we had two concurrent jobs executing,
  which is recommended for a single CPU system.  Do not set the number
  of jobs too high, or your compile will actually take longer to
  complete than it would if you did a "normal" build.

  If you are using [1mdistcc[22m, and you had two other host machines (red,
  blue) participating, you would do something like:



  $ export DISTCC_HOSTS='localhost red blue'
  $ make -j 6 CXX=distcc



  The actual speed-up, if any, is dependant on a number of factors, such
  as number of CPUs / hosts, etc.  The [1mdistcc [22mdocumentation recommends
  using a -j value of twice the number of CPUs available to keep all of
  them busy.

  Some timing information.  The following should only be used for
  illustration; your actual results may vary.  The test involves a
  complete make distclean to the final binary.

  +o  P4 3.2Ghz HT: "standard" make: 12m 49s

  +o  P4 3.2Ghz HT: make -j 2: 11m 24s

  In the above example, we see that with a single CPU, a multi-stage
  [1mmake [22mdoes not significantly decrease compile time.

  Once the compile is done, switch to superuser:


       $ su
       # make install
       # exit



     [1mNOTE[22m:  subsequent configuration steps assume that you are within
  the MythTV directory that you cd'd to above.


  [1m5.4.1.  Enabling real-time scheduling of the display thread.[0m

  MythTV supports real-time scheduling of the video output thread. There
  are three ways to go about enabling this: You can use rlimits, you can
  use the realtime security module, or on older systems you can SUID the
  executable. Enabling real-time scheduling is optional, but can make
  the video display smoother, especially if you are decoding HDTV.


  [1m5.4.1.1.  rlimits[0m

  The rlimits method is the preferred method and is included in Linux
  2.6.12 and above. Unfortunately, you need PAM version 0.79 or above,
  which may not be supported by your distribution yet. Assuming anyone
  running [1mmythfrontend [22mis in the audio group and rlimits are supported,
  all you need to do is place this in your /etc/security/limits.conf



       *               -       rtprio     0
       *               -       nice       0
       @audio          -       rtprio     50
       @audio          -       nice       0


  [1m5.4.1.2.  realtime module[0m

  The second option is to use the Linux realtime kernel module.  This is
  will be phased out over time, but is currently supported by many
  distributions that do not yet support rlimits. If you are not using
  the distribution kernel you must configure your kernel with:


       Security options : [*] Enable different security models
       Security options : [M] Default Linux Capabilties



  You may also need to install the realtime module, using your distribu-
  tion's realtime package. Assuming the users who will be running [1mmyth-[0m
  [1mfrontend [22mwill be in the audio group you can get the GUID of a named
  group like so:


       $ grep audio /etc/group



  If the number printed out from the grep was 18, you can now load this
  module as root before starting [1mmythfrontend[22m:


       # modprobe realtime gid=18



  [1m5.4.1.3.  run as root option (not safe)[0m

  The final and least preferred option is to set the sticky bit on the
  [1mmythfrontend [22mexecutable. This [1mopens a security hole[22m, but is the only
  option on systems that do not support either rlimits or the realtime
  module. This does not work on modern distributions either, and is [4mnot[0m
  [4mrecommended[24m on any system connected to the Internet. This may also
  make it impossible to debug MythTV without running [1mgdb [22mas root. If you
  would still like to do this, you just need to run this as root:


       # chmod a+s /usr/local/bin/mythfrontend /usr/local/bin/mythtv



  [1m5.4.2.  Frontend-only configuration[0m

  Since MythTV uses a client/server architecture, multiple frontend
  computers can simultaneously access content on a Myth system.  Live
  TV, watching and scheduling recordings, etc. are all possible from
  multiple frontends.

  To get a better picture of what is needed to run a frontend, note the
  following:

  You do NOT need the MySQL server installed on your remote frontend

  You do NOT need XMLTV installed on your remote frontend

  You do NOT need to run the mythtv-setup program on your frontend
  machine

  Other than the exclusion of the MySQL server and XMLTV, the MythTV
  compilation procedure is the same as when you're setting up both a
  backend and a frontend.  However, you [4mwill[24m need to install the
  database access libraries.

  Once MythTV is compiled and installed:

  Run the mythtv-setup program on your Master backend. Under the
  "General" menu, change the IP address of the current machine (by
  default, "127.0.0.1") to the real external IP address - 127.0.0.1 is
  the loopback address and no external machine can access it. Change the
  Master Server IP setting to the same IP address as well.

  Run the mythfrontend program on your frontend machine, and a "Database
  Configuration" screen should appear.  Set the "Host name" field to
  point to your Master backend's IP address.


  [1m5.5.  Gentoo[0m

  Installation of MythTV on Gentoo consists of simply emerging the
  desired ebuild because all of the packages are now part of the
  official Portage tree.


       $ su -
       # emerge --sync # make sure portage is up to date.
       # vi /etc/make.conf



  Add mysql to your USE variable.  i.e. USE="mysql ...."


       # emerge mythtv



  [1m6.  MySQL.[0m

  When you install MySQL 5.x you will also want to comment out "log-bin"
  in your my.cnf configuration file. This option will quickly fill your
  "/var" disk partition with many gigabytes of data, unless you are
  doing database replication and deleting these files regularly.

  [1m6.1.  Distribution-specific information[0m

  [1m6.1.1.  Mandriva[0m

  If this is the system maintaining the database, make sure that MySQL
  is running and started at boot.  Click on Mandriva Control
  Center->System->Services, find MySQL and click the "On Boot" button
  and the "Start" button if the MySQL status shows that it isn't running
  yet.



    [1mNOTE[22m:  There have been reports that MySQL isn't starting at boot.
  If this is happening to you, try running the following commands.


       $ su
       # chkconfig --level 35 mysql on
       # /etc/rc.d/init.d/mysql start
       # exit



  [1m6.1.2.  Red Hat Linux and Fedora Core[0m

  If this is the system maintaining the database, make sure that MySQL
  is running and started at boot. Click on Redhat menu>Server
  Settings>Services and enter the root password when asked. Check
  "mysqld" and then click Start.  Click Save, then close the window.

  This can be done from the command line by typing:


       # /sbin/chkconfig mysqld on
       # /sbin/service mysqld start



  [1m6.1.3.  Gentoo[0m

  After installing MySQL you need to initialize the database by running
  [1mmysql_install_db [22mas root.

  [1m6.2.  Setting up the initial database[0m

  This step is only required on the system maintaining the database,
  which may or may not be one of your MythTV boxes.  If the database is
  on a non-MythTV machine you'll need to copy the database/mc.sql file
  to it.

  To setup the initial MySQL databases:


       $ cd database



  [1m6.2.1.  Mandriva and Red Hat Linux/Fedora Core[0m



       $ mysql -u root < mc.sql



  [1m6.2.2.  Debian 3.0[0m



       $ mysql < mc.sql



  [1m6.2.3.  Gentoo[0m



       $ su
       # mysql < /usr/share/mythtv/database/mc.sql



  [1mNOTE[22m: It is good practice to set a root password for MySQL. Instruc-
  tions for doing so can be found on MySQL's web site at
  http://www.mysql.com/doc/en/Security.html <http://www.mysql.com/doc/en/Security.html>.

  [1m6.2.4.  Modifying access to the MySQL database for multiple systems[0m

  If you're going to have multiple systems accessing a master database,
  you must grant access to the database from remote systems.  By
  default, the mc.sql script is only granting access to the local host.

  To allow other hosts access to your master database, you can either
  set it up for no security at all, or with more granularity.  Note that
  the "%" is the wildcard character in MySQL.



         [1mNOTE[22m:  The "no security" option is [4mvery[24m dangerous unless
  you're in a controlled environment.  This example has no security at
  all, and allows access from any host.


       $ mysql -u root mythconverg
       mysql> grant all on mythconverg.* to mythtv@"%" identified by "mythtv";
       mysql> flush privileges;



  For a more secure setup, you can restrict which machines or subnets
  have access. If you have a complete DNS system operational, you could
  do the following:


       $ mysql -u root mythconverg
       mysql> grant all on mythconverg.* to mythtv@"%.mydomain.com" identified by "mythtv";
       mysql> flush privileges;



  Finally, if you just want to restrict by IP subnet (in this example,
  the 192.168.1. network):


       $ mysql -u root mythconverg
       mysql> grant all on mythconverg.* to mythtv@"192.168.1.%" identified by "mythtv";
       mysql> flush privileges;

  You'll also need to check that the "networking" feature of MySQL is
  turned on. Check that /etc/mysql/my.cnf [4mdoes[24m [4mnot[24m contain skip-
  networking.  If it does, remove it.  Also verify that bind-address is
  set to your IP address instead of 127.0.0.1.  If you change either of
  these items, restart [1mMySQL[22m.

  [1mNOTE[22m:  Your distribution may have a customized MySQL configuration
  file; in Mandriva, check /etc/sysconfig/mysqld for additional
  configuration.


  [1m7.  Configuring Sound.[0m

  If your video doesn't appear to be in-sync with your audio and you're
  using an analog video capture card and a soundcard to capture audio,
  it could be because you are listening to the real-time audio from your
  video card rather than after it's been processed and synchronized to
  the video by MythTV.  Because MythTV is a personal video recorder,
  "Live TV" isn't really live - to let you pause live TV, MythTV is
  actually encoding the video, saving to disk, and then playing it back.
  This procedure puts your MythTV "live" TV about 2 seconds behind real-
  time, so it's important that you're not listening to the live audio.
  However, if you're having an issue where the audio and video aren't
  synchronized by small but varying amount, it's most likely because the
  sound driver that you're using doesn't have the DSP_CAP_REALTIME
  capability.  This was the case with ALSA (0.5), but not with newer
  versions.  See the ``Troubleshooting Audio'' section for more
  information if you're having issues with sound.  Also, ensure that no
  other programs are grabbing the audio output, like [1marts [22mor [1mesd[22m.

  What you need to do is to mute the "line-in" of your sound card and
  also set it as the recording source.

  There are two ways to do this.  Graphically, and from the command
  line.


  [1m7.1.  Graphically setting up the mixer[0m

  [1m7.1.1.  Mandriva and Red Hat Linux/Fedora Core[0m

  Open Kmix by clicking K->Multimedia->Sound->Kmix for Mandriva, or

  RedHat Menu>Sound & Video>Volume Control



  Click on Settings->Configure  Make sure that "Tick Marks" and "Show
  labels" have "X"'s in them.  This will make it easier to find the
  correct audio source.  Click OK.

  On the mixer page, look for Line-In on your sound card.  You should
  see two LED's - a green one at the top, and a red one at the bottom.
  The green one at the top is for muting; you want to make sure that the
  green LED is a dark green, meaning that it's "off".  You also want to
  click on the red LED so that it turns bright red, indicating that it's
  "ON"; this insures that the Line-in is used as the source.  Click OK,
  and make sure that you save the settings so that this is your default.


  [1m7.1.1.1.  Using ALSA.[0m

  To use ALSA, you'll need to correctly setup your asoundrc file.
  Configuring this file is beyond the scope of this HOWTO.  Once ALSA is
  working correctly, change the output sound device in
  mythfrontend->setup->Audio from /dev/dsp to ALSA:default.  This field
  may be edited to suit your ALSA requirements.


  [1m7.2.  Setting the mixer from the command line[0m

  If you have installed the alsa-utils package, then the [1mamixer [22mprogram
  can be used to setup the mixer.  The "Master" volume setting is only
  required on a frontend machine to ensure that the sound channels are
  unmuted and configured for outputting sound.  The "Line" and "Capture"
  controls are required for your sound card to actually capture audio
  from the external Line-in if it's connected to an analog frame
  grabber.  Not all sound cards have a "Capture" control, but if yours
  does and you don't set it then MythTV will not capture audio.


  ______________________________________________________________________
  Note the spelling in the following commands.
  ______________________________________________________________________



       $ amixer set Master,0 100%,100% unmute
       $ amixer set PCM,0 100%,100% unmute
       $ amixer set Line,0 75%,75% mute captur
       $ amixer set Capture,0 100%,100% captur
       $ su
       # alsactl store
       # exit
       $



  If you have multiple sound cards, then use the -c parameter to specify
  which card to adjust.  Note that the first card will be "0", the
  second will be "1", etc.

  That takes care of setting the volume correctly, and the ALSA startup
  script will restore the volume after a reboot.  If you find that your
  sound is distorted, it's possible that the levels in the above
  examples are too high for your particular hardware combination.  Try
  reducing the percentages by 5-10% and checking again.  Once you're
  satisfied, re-run the alsactl store command.

  You may also use the [1malsamixer [22mprogram to set the volume. If you are
  using an ALSA version after 1.0.6, use [1malsamixer -V all [22mFirst, start
  [1malsamixer [22mfrom the command line.  You should start out on the "Master"
  volume control slider.  Use the up and down cursor to set the master
  volume to around 75%.  Next, use the left and right cursor keys to
  move around on the screen until you find the "Line" slider.  Press
  SPACE to set it as the capture source, set the level to around 50-75%
  and press "M" to mute it.  You can now press ESC to exit out of the
  [1malsamixer [22mprogram.  You can also have MythTV manage all volume and
  mute settings, but this will only affect the "Master" or PCM volume,
  not the capture volume.  See the mythfrontend setup page for options.

  Finally, if you've performed all of the above steps, and you still
  don't seem to have any sound, it's possible that your video capture
  device is muting the audio output.


       $ v4lctl -c /dev/video0 setattr mute off



  [1m8.  Setting up a remote control.[0m

  MythTV does not have native remote control receiver and decoder
  software built-in.  Instead, remote control functions are implemented
  by cooperating with [1mlirc[22m, the Linux Infrared Remote Control program.
  [1mlirc [22mhandles the IR hardware and passes keystrokes to MythTV, which
  then acts as if the user had pressed the keys on the keyboard.  The
  file keys.txt describes the keys used to control MythTV.



            [1mNOTE[22m: If you are running Mandriva, you may install
  [1mlirc [22mby executing: # urpmi lirc lirc-remotes and bypass the manual
  compilation steps described below by jumping to the ``Completing the
  lirc install'' section. See the contrib/mandrake91.etc.sysconfig.lircd
  file for an example of how to configure lircd.

  Some IR devices require a kernel recompile, and some don't. However,
  all at least require having the kernel source available as a resource
  for the lirc build process.


  [1m8.1.  Gentoo[0m

  To install lirc on Gentoo, all you need to do is:


       # emerge lirc



  [1m8.2.  Obtaining and compiling lirc[0m

  You're going to need to download and compile [1mlircd[22m.  Go to
  http://www.lirc.org <http://www.lirc.org> and download lirc; as of
  2006-01-21, the version available is 0.8.0.  Grab the remotes.tar.bz2
  file as well.


       $ tar -xjf lirc-0.8.0.tar.bz2
       $ cd lirc-0.8.0
       $ ./setup.sh



  You're going to need to know what sort of receiver you have and where
  it's connected.  In the case of the Pinnacle Studio TV card, with the
  IR receiver connected to COM1 (/dev/ttys0), once the configuration
  menu comes up, perform the configuration by going to Driver Configura-
  tion->Other Serial Port Devices->Pinnacle Systems Receiver->OK and on
  the next page select COM1->OK.

  Each remote is different; some remote receivers connect directly to
  your capture card and not to a serial port, so make sure that you've
  got the correct one.

  You then click "Save Configuration and run configure" to continue.

  Make sure you read the last text generated by the configure step. It
  will tell you if you require a kernel recompile, and what the name of
  your kernel module will be (if necessary). For instance a home-built
  receiver may require a kernel recompile, so you would be notified that
  you will have to load the lirc_serial module. If you did not get any
  such messages skip the kernel recompile steps below and go directly to
  making and installing the lirc driver.

  Once the configuration step is complete:


       $ make
       $ su
       # make install
       # chmod 666 /dev/lircd



  At this point, if you're using a serial receiver, check that there's a
  lirc device in /dev:


       $ ls -l /dev/li*
       lr-xr-xr-x    1 root     root            5 Jan 27 09:00 /dev/lirc -> ttyS0
       srw-rw-rw-    1 root     root            0 Jan 27 15:01 /dev/lircd=
       prw-r--r--    1 root     root            0 Jan 27 09:00 /dev/lircm|



  As you can see, there's a link from /dev/lirc to ttyS0, a.k.a. "COM1",
  which is appropriate for the Pinnacle Systems PCTV Pro.  However, you
  may notice something like this:


       crw-------    1 root     root      61,   0 Dec 31  1969 lirc



  Some IR receivers (including some homebrew units) use a character
  device as their data interface as opposed to a link to a serial port.
  If the make install step has created a character device for you, don't
  replace it with a link to a COM port.

  So, if the link or character device was not created (but should have
  been), ensure that you ran the make install step as root.  If it still
  doesn't work, then there are three options.  The first option is to
  re-read the [1mlirc [22mdocumentation to determine whether your IR receiver
  is a character device or should be a link to a serial port and to
  create the link/character device manually.  In this example, the IR
  device is connected to ttyS0.  If it were connected to "COM2", then
  use ttyS1, etc.


       $ su
       # cd /dev
       # ln -sf ttyS0 lirc
       # exit
       $



       [1mNOTE[22m:  The above example assumes that your receiver uses the
  standard serial driver.  Some receivers do not, including receivers
  that plug into a TV capture card.  Check the lirc documentation, but
  it may be necessary to replace the link created above with a character
  pipe:


       # mknod /dev/lirc c 61 0



  See the lirc documentation for additional information.  The lirc
  installation [4mshould[24m create this for you, so manually creating it
  indicates that your lirc installation may have other issues.

  The second option is to post your issue to the [4mlirc[24m list, not the
  mythtv-users list.  The lirc programmers will be the ones that can
  assist you best.

  The third option is to dispense with lirc altogether by purchasing an
  IR keyboard (various options exist, although Chicony appears to work
  for some people) and a learning remote control.  The IR keyboard
  receiver plugs into the PS/2 keyboard port on your PC and you would
  train your learning remote to emulate the various keystrokes from
  keys.txt of your IR keyboard.  Using this method removes lirc entirely
  from the picture - your remote will be sending keypresses that your PC
  "sees" on the keyboard port.


  [1m8.3.  Completing the lirc install[0m



      [1mNOTE to Mandriva 9.1 users[22m: skip to the manual start paragraph
  below.

  If the lirc configure program / compile did not mention anything about
  a kernel module, then you are finished. If it did mention a kernel
  module, you must edit the /etc/modules.conf file. Add this line as the
  first thing in the file.  It must come first, or it may not work.


       alias char-major-61 XXX



  replace XXX with the name which you determined earlier, which in this
  example was "lirc_serial"


       $ su
       # modprobe lirc_serial
       # /sbin/ldconfig



  Next, we're going to manually start lircd the first time.  Mandriva
  9.1 users, type: # /etc/rc.d/init.d/lircd start instead of:


  # /usr/local/sbin/lircd



  [1mNOTE[22m:  Read this next section if you're not familiar with how lirc
  works!

  There are two separate files used by lirc, and both are required for
  your remote control to do anything useful. First is the lircd.conf
  file.  lircd.conf tells the lirc daemon how to interpret the IR pulses
  that it receives from a remote control and what name to assign to each
  sequence of pulses.  Without getting too involved, a particular series
  of pulses may correlate to "Channel Up".  The lircd.conf file will
  then contain a line that looks something like this:



                 ChannelUp                0x0000000000001020



  The lircd.conf file can have multiple remote controls defined.

  The second file is lircrc, which takes the name of the button which
  was pressed ("ChannelUp") in the above example, and correlates that to
  an action to be performed by a program using the remote control.  So
  in MythTV, ChannelUp means one thing, while in [1mmplayer [22mit means
  something different.  lircrc gives you the flexibility of taking the
  name of the button and having it perform different actions depending
  on which program you're using at the time.

  [1mNOTE[22m:  The definitions in lircd.conf come from the user community, and
  there is no standard for the common button names.  One lircd.conf file
  may contain a definition for a button called "ChannelUp", while
  another may contain a definition for "Chan+".  Your lircrc file must
  therefore be configured appropriately, or it won't work.

  If this fails, complaining of a missing lircd.conf file, then you must
  find or make one. First look for a pre-made configuration file at
  http://lirc.sourceforge.net/remotes/
  <http://lirc.sourceforge.net/remotes/>.  Mandriva 9.1 users, look in
  /usr/share/lirc-remotes. If you find one your remotes either on the
  website or in /usr/share, download or copy the file, name it
  lircd.conf and put it in your /etc directory. If you couldn't find
  your remote, you must make your own lircd.conf file.

  To make your own lircd.conf file


       $ irrecord myremote



  Follow the on-screen directions to train your remote and define keys.
  If your remote ends up working well, you should consider submitting
  your lircd.conf file back to the lirc developers. Once finished:


       $ su
       # cp myremote /etc/lircd.conf



  now try to start lircd again:


       # /usr/local/sbin/lircd



  Now, we're going to add the commands necessary for lircd to run each
  time we boot. Mandriva 9.1 users, you can execute:


       $ su
       # chkconfig --level 35 lircd on
       # exit



  All other distributions:


       # cd /etc/rc.d
       # cat >> rc.local
       echo "Starting lircd"
       /usr/local/sbin/lircd
       ^D
       # exit
       $



  This takes care of the lircd portion, which "listens" for the IR
  signals. If everything went well, the install script for lircd put an
  appropriate configuration file for your remote into /etc/lircd.conf
  This file maps the buttons on the remote control to the IR pulses
  coming from the receiver.

  The next step is to convert those signals into something that can be
  used to control MythTV.  MythTV now includes native support for lirc
  and can interact directly with



       $ cd ~/mythtv-0.21/contrib/configfiles
       $ cp lircrc.example ~/.lircrc



  or


       $ cp lircrc.example.pinnaclestudiopctv ~/.lircrc



  if you've got a Pinnacle Studio PCTV remote.


       $ irw


  Start pressing the keys on your remote; [1mirw [22mwill print the name of the
  button as it is defined in your /etc/lircd.conf. If you don't see any-
  thing at this point, you need to troubleshoot further by going back to
  the lirc home page and investigating from there.

  If it is working, then press [1mCTRL-C [22mto abort the program.  Once you
  know that your remote is working, you can either recompile MythTV with
  native lirc support by enabling it in [1mconfigure [22mor you need to run the
  [1mirxevent [22mprogram, which takes the key presses and sends them to
  MythTV.  If you use native lirc support, you don't need to run
  [1mirxevent[22m.  If you are going to use irxevent, then you need to run it
  like this:


       $ irxevent &



  If [1mirxevent [22misn't running, then MythTV will not respond to your remote
  control unless you're using native lirc support.


  [1m8.4.  Additional information for lirc[0m

  Take a look at the lircrc.example files in the contrib/configfiles/
  directory.  In my case, (Pinnacle Studio card) the channel up and down
  functions weren't working, due to the fact that the button names were
  different than the default lircrc.example file that came with MythTV.

  The lircrc.example file has this:


       begin
           prog = irxevent
           button = ChannelUp
           config = Key Up CurrentWindow
       end

       begin
           prog = irxevent
           button = ChannelDown
           config = Key Down CurrentWindow
       end



  but the /etc/lircd.conf that comes in the lircd package defines the
  buttons for the Pinnacle Studio PCTV as:


                 channel+                 0x0000000000000017
                 channel-                 0x000000000000001C



  rather than "ChannelUp" and "ChannelDown".  I added the following to
  my /home/[yourusername]/.lircrc file:



  begin
      prog = irxevent
      button = channel+
      repeat = 3
      config = Key Up CurrentWindow
  end

  begin
      prog = irxevent
      button = channel-
      repeat = 3
      config = Key Down CurrentWindow
  end



  which took care of basic functionality.  Because the PCTV Studio
  remote has additional buttons, look at the contrib/configfiles/lir-
  crc.example.pinnaclestudiopctv for an example of how to define addi-
  tional buttons, and how to debug potential button name conflicts
  between the lircrc.example file and how [1myour [22mremote defines the button
  names.

  By examining the button names defined in /etc/lircd.conf and using the
  [1mirw [22mprogram to make sure that your remote is working, you can create
  the appropriate mappings in .lircrc to get excellent remote
  functionality with MythTV.

  Note the [1mrepeat = [22mparameter.  This informs the irxevent program to
  pass through every third keypress.  By default, lirc will only send
  one keypress to the application, even if you're holding down the key.
  The actual [1mrepeat = [22mnumber will vary from system to system, so
  experiment and see which value works best for you.


  [1m8.5.  Configuring lirc for use with an IR blaster[0m

  Lirc has support for various IR transmitters. A popular model is the
  Actisys IR-200L http://store.snapstreamstore.com/accessories.html
  <http://store.snapstreamstore.com/accessories.html>. It was originally
  designed for IRDA communication, but can be used to transmit A/V
  remote control codes. By using the lirc SIR driver, this device can
  easily be integrated with MythTV. I have tested this device with an
  AT&T DCT2000 digital cable box but the instructions can be used to
  configure other IRDA devices and A/V remotes.

  Follow the steps in the previous section.  When you run setup.sh,
  select option 1, driver configuration. From here select option 6, IrDA
  hardware.  Select your appropriate device and the corresponding serial
  port, then Save configuration & run configure from the main menu. Once
  configure is done type:


       $ make



  Please note: unlike the Pinnacle receiver above you will be compiling
  lircd in addition to a kernel module for the SIR transmitter.
  Depending on whether you have your serial port driver configured as a
  kernel module you might see the following message during make:



  lirc_sir.c:56:2: warning: #warning
  "******************************************"

  lirc_sir.c:57:2: warning: #warning "Your serial port driver is compiled into "

  lirc_sir.c:58:2: warning: #warning "the kernel. You will have to release the "

  lirc_sir.c:59:2: warning: #warning "port you want to use for LIRC with:"

  lirc_sir.c:60:2: warning: #warning "setserial /dev/ttySx uart none"

  lirc_sir.c:61:2: warning: #warning
  "******************************************"



  If you do receive this statement make sure to run the [1msetserial[0m
  command before you load the lirc_sir module. Follow this with the
  install:


       $ su
       # make install



  You will notice that lirc installs the kernel module in
  /lib/modules/uname -a/misc.

  The configuration for starting [1mlircd [22mdiffers if you're going to be
  sending and receiving IR versus just receiving.



       # cd /etc/rc.d
       # cat >> rc.local
       echo "Starting lircd"
       setserial /dev/ttySx uart none        # (if required)
       modprobe lirc_sir
       /usr/local/sbin/lircd
       ^D
       # exit
       $



  At this point you have to populate the /etc/lircd.conf file with the
  proper codes for your A/V remote. You should be able to find your
  remote within the lirc remote tar file located at
  http://www.lirc.org/remotes.tar.bz2
  <http://www.lirc.org/remotes.tar.bz2>. In my case I extracted the file
  from remotes/motorola/DCT2000 (gi-motorola-dct2000)

  To test the lirc_sir module you can run [1mirw [22mto verify the codes are
  being received. If everything is configured correctly you should see
  something similar to the following:


       $ irw
       0000000000007ff0 00 1 gi-motorola-dct2000
       000000000000bff8 00 2 gi-motorola-dct2000
       000000000000f7f0 00 ENTER gi-motorola-dct2000

  Once you've verified lirc is working you can press [1mCTRL-C [22mto exit [1mirw[0m
  and configure the channel changing script.

  The path to the channel changing script will need to be entered on the
  mythtv-setup screen for Input Connections.

  This csh script will be called each time MythTV needs to change the
  channel.  Below is a copy of the script followed by the corresponding
  perl script.  Make sure both are in your path. Also make sure you
  leave the #!/bin/csh setting and not change it to Bourne or bash. This
  will create a frustrating symptom to diagnose where MythTV cannot open
  /dev/device. Unlike Bourne or bash, csh scripts automatically close
  parent file descriptors before they start.


       $ cd /usr/local/bin
       # su
       # cat > change_channel.csh
       #!/bin/csh
       echo "changing to $1"
       /usr/local/bin/channel.pl $1 &
       ^D
       # chmod a+x change_channel.csh
       # exit
       $ exit



  See contrib/channel.pl for the actual file.  Copy it to
  /usr/local/bin/

  The last statement within the perl script is the lirc rc command. This
  is the command that transmits the code to your cable/DSS box. Make
  sure to have the IRDA device within a few feet of the box.


  [1m9.  Configuring MythTV.[0m

  By this point, all of the compile-time prerequisites have been
  installed, [1mmysql [22mis running and has had its initial database setup.
  It's now time to configure MythTV.



      [1mNOTE[22m:  If you're running Debian unstable and you have compiled
  MythTV from source, you will need to install an additional package
  before you will be able to run MythTV.  Execute the following to
  install the MySQL driver for QT.


       $ su -
       # apt-get install libqt3c102-mt-mysql
       # exit



  [1m9.1.  Configuring the Master backend system[0m

  Open a shell and decide where you will store your video files.  This
  may be one directory or multiple directories on the same or different
  filesystems. There is no default directory used for new recordings,
  you [1mmust [22mcreate at least one storage directory and configure Myth to
  use it by running [1mmythtv-setup[22m.  If you do not do this, then MythTV
  will be unable to record anything.  The following example is specific
  for /var/video, but the same instructions would apply for any
  directory name you choose to use. See the ``Advanced Partition
  Formatting'' section for hints on creating a partition for MythTV.



       $ su
       # mkdir /var/video
       # chmod a+rwx /var/video
       # exit



  [1mNOTE[22m:  The last slash "/" is not required.


  [1mTIP[22m:  Try not to have your video mount point on the same partition as
  your root partition, which could lead to the filling up of your root
  partition with video data if the mount fails.  For example:

  If /var/video is created on your root partition and you then perform a
  mount of another drive to this directory there won't be any problems
  if everything is working the way it should. However, if the mount
  fails for some reason, /var/video still exists, so MythTV will find
  the directory and write files to it.  If your / mount point is space
  limited, /var/video will [1malso [22mbe space limited, and it won't take long
  to fill the partition.  This will cause a number of side-effects, most
  of them bad.  Instead, create subdirectories as the destination for
  the storage group.

  Your directory structure could then look something like this:


       /mnt/video/drive1/video
       /mnt/video/drive2/video



  Your /etc/fstab would look like this:


       /dev/hdb1 /mnt/video/drive1
       /dev/hdc1 /mnt/video/drive2



  Because the Storage Group path is /mnt/video/drive1/video, if the
  mythbackend can only find /mnt/video/drive1 it will [4mnot[24m write files to
  that share.

  After you create the desired directory or directories for storing your
  video files, you will need to add them to the proper Storage Group
  using [1mmythtv-setup[22m.  This procedure is described below in the
  ``Storage Groups'' section.

  The first thing to configure is the Master backend system.  If you are
  running multiple backend systems, the Master backend will make all
  decisions about which programs will be recorded on which tuners.  If
  you have only one backend, then it will be its own master.


  The Master backend will always choose the first available tuner in the
  same order as you add cards through "mythtv-setup". In other words,
  the second card you add will only be used when there are two
  overlapping recordings, the third when there are three, and so on.
  Therefore, you will want to have the greatest amount of disk space on
  the Master backend because its tuner will always be the first choice.
  You will then want to add your ``other backends'' in the order of your
  preference for recording.



        [1mNOTE[22m:  It is possible to [4mnot[24m have the cards on the Master
  backend be the first ones used.  However, if you are new to MythTV it
  is easier to configure the Master backend first before moving on to
  the Slaves, at least until you become more familiar with the MythTV
  system.  See ``Advanced Backend Configurations'' for information on
  configuring multiple backend systems in various ways.

  Because MythTV uses a database to store all configuration variables,
  part of the bootstrap of MythTV is to indicate the location of the
  MySQL database server. If the frontend, backend and MySQL database
  server are all going to be running on the same box, you can continue
  to the next step.  If not, you'll need to change the Host Name in the
  "Database Configuration" screen of the mythfrontend program.



   [1mNOTE[22m:  Users that have been running the frontend and the backend on
  different machines have stated that they have been having issues with
  remote access to the MySQL database.  The following instructions may
  or may not work.  Add the following to /etc/my.cnf on the backend
  machine and restart MySQL.


       skip-innodb
       set-variable=thread_stack=256k



  Run the setup program:


       $ mythtv-setup



  The backend setup program will start and offer you a number of
  choices.  It is [4mstrongly[24m recommended that you go through them in
  order.

  The first question will ask if you wish to clear out your existing
  configurations for your capture cards.  Initially, you should say
  "YES" so that there are no surprises later.

  The next question will ask you if you wish to clear out your video
  source information.  You should answer "YES" to this as well.


  Once the graphical setup starts, you'll see that there are six choices



  The Storage Directories feature is available only in the SVN version
                                of MythTV.


  1. General

  2. Capture Cards

  3. Video Sources

  4. Input connections

  5. Channel Editor

  6. Storage Directories

  Use the arrow keys to move around, and press the space bar to select
  which option you wish to configure.


  [1m9.1.1.  General[0m

  The first screen of the General configuration deals with IP addresses
  of the system that you're running mythtv-setup on and any master
  backend you may have.  If you've only got one machine, then the
  default values are fine and you can move to the next page by pressing
  the space bar.  If you need to move around the screen, use the arrow
  keys to move focus between settings, not the mouse.

  If you will be deploying multiple backends, or if your backend is on
  one system and you're running the frontend on another machine then [4mdo[0m
  [4mnot[24m use the "127.0.0.1" IP address.

  [1mNOTE[22m: If you modify the 127.0.0.1 address and use a "real" IP address,
  you must use real IP addresses in both fields, otherwise your frontend
  machines will generate "Unexpected response to MYTH_PROTO_VERSION"
  errors.

  Changing any of the port settings is very strongly discouraged.  (If
  you do accidentally change them, the defaults are 6543 for the
  master/backend server, and 6544 for the HTTP requests)

  Once you're satisfied with the values, move the focus down to Next and
  hit the space bar.

  The next screen details the Host-specific Backend setup.  This is
  where you will set the specific directory paths for this particular
  backend.  Make sure that you've followed the steps at the beginning of
  this section and created a directory that exists and that MythTV will
  have write privileges to.  When you're done, press Next to continue,
  taking you to the Global Backend Setup.

  On the Global Backend Setup configure your backend with the
  appropriate settings.  Use the left and right arrow keys to iterate
  through the choices available on each setting, and the up and down
  keys to move between settings.  Move to Finish when you're done and
  press the space bar, taking you back to the main configuration screen.


  [1m9.1.2.  Capture Cards[0m

  You should have no capture cards defined, so the highlight will be on
  (New Capture Card).  Press space to begin.

  Choose the appropriate settings for your particular tuner.  Use the
  arrow keys to move around and to make your choices, and press RETURN
  when complete.  Pressing RETURN will take you back to the Capture
  Cards screen; if you have additional capture cards in this machine,
  press the space bar when the highlight is on the (New Capture Card)
  row to define another card.

  If you have made a mistake, you can delete a card by highlighting it
  and pressing the 'D' key, or you can highlight it and press the RETURN
  or 'E' key to edit it.

  Once you have no additional cards to setup, press ESC.



     [1mNOTE[22m: If you have a dual digital/analog card, such as the pcHDTV
  cards and some DViCO cards, then you should not configure this as two
  separate cards. Configure the digital portion as a DVB card, then
  click on the "Analog Options" button within the DVB configuration
  panel for the card and configure the analog portion of the card there.


  [1m9.1.3.  Video Sources[0m

  When you start, the highlight should be on (New Video Source).  Press
  the space bar to begin.  The first field asks for the name of the
  video source.  You may choose something easy to remember, like
  "Antenna" or "Cable".  Once you've chosen a name, press the down arrow
  to move to the next field.

  If you're in North America, change the grabber to
  "SchedulesDirect.org(Internal)", then continue pressing the down arrow
  to move to the next field.  Fill in the username (lowercase only) and
  password that you have established with Schedules Direct, then move to
  the "Retrieve Listings" button and press the space bar.

  [1mNOTE[22m: You need [1mwget [22mversion 1.9.1 or higher to use Schedules Direct.

  The mythtv-setup program will contact the Schedules Direct servers and
  get your account information.  Once you're done, you may click the
  Finish button and skip the next few paragraphs in this document since
  they only apply to users that are using the external XMLTV script to
  get their guide data.

  If you wish to continue using the XMLTV grabber, then move to the
  Zip/postal code field and put in the appropriate value.

  If you're outside of North America, then some manual interaction will
  be required with XMLTV. You may need to switch from the MythTV setup
  program to the console it was run on to interact with XMLTV.

  Once you have chosen your provider, press RETURN to continue.  XMLTV
  will now begin collecting the initial data for your location.  The
  screen may blank for a few seconds to several minutes, depending on
  the load of the listings provider and the speed of your connection to
  the Internet.  Be patient!


  You will then be returned to the Video Sources screen.  If you have
  multiple video sources available, such as Antenna, Cable, etc, go
  ahead and define them all, even if they're not all going to be
  physically connected to the master backend server.  Once you're done,
  press ESC to return to the main screen.


  [1m9.1.4.  Input Connections[0m

  The final configuration item is Input Connections.  On this screen,
  you will associate the various video sources you defined earlier with
  a physical input to a encoder card.  It's entirely possible that you
  have multiple tuners, and each tuner has a different input, so on this
  screen you let MythTV know which device will connect to which input
  source.

  When you start this screen, you should see a listing of the various
  input connections available on each of the Capture cards you defined
  earlier.  For example, you may have a capture card with a tuner, a
  SVideo and a Composite connection.  If you wanted to associate the
  tuner (a.k.a., "Television") with an "Antenna" source you defined in
  Video Sources, you would move to the /dev/videodevice (Television) ->
  line and press the space bar.  Using the left and right arrow keys
  will show you the various choices you have already created for video
  source.  In our case, you would use the left/right cursor keys until
  "Antenna" was shown in the Video Source field.  Press down to move to
  the next setting.

  On the connection pane there is a "Scan for channels" button, if you
  are configuring a digital source such as a DVB card, you need scan for
  channels and you must do this before pressing the "Fetch channels from
  listings source" button. You may scan for analog channels on an analog
  input, but this is not needed.


  The other button is called "Fetch channels from listings source". As
  long as you have a real listings source you should fetch channels from
  them for analog channels. You can do this for digital sources as well
  (unless the listing source is transmitted EIT data). If you are using
  XMLTV, you may need to switch from the MythTV setup program to the
  console it was run on to interact with XMLTV after pressing this
  button. It is possible to fetch the channels on the command line using
  mythfilldatabase. But if you need to do this, you will probably need
  to re-enter the MythTV setup program to configure the "Starting
  channel" setting for this source->input connection.



        [1mNOTE[22m:  If you have a Hauppauge PVR-500, you must think of
  it has two PVR-150's on a single PCI card.  For example, if you have a
  single PVR-500 card, it will appear as /dev/video0 and /dev/video1.
  Each /dev/video device will have a Tuner input.  Once you're done,
  press RETURN to go back to the Input Connections screen.  You would
  then finish associating the video sources to any other hardware
  devices you have available.



     [1mNOTE[22m:  Don't add a video source to a hardware input if you don't
  actually have anything connected there.  For example, adding "Cable"
  to the Tuner and to the Composite inputs without having something
  connected to Composite will lead to blank recordings.

  Press ESC to return to the main menu, and press ESC again if you have
  no further items to configure, thereby returning you to the command
  line.


  [1m9.1.5.  Channel Editor[0m

  The channel editor is used to globally alter channel information,
  including items like hue, contrast, fine tuning and others.  Users in
  North America shouldn't run the channel editor until you've completed
  the initial mythtv-setup and ran [1mmythfilldatabase [22mat least once to
  populate the database.


  [1m9.1.6.  Storage Groups[0m



                            New in MythTV 0.21

  [1m9.1.6.1.  Introduction.[0m

  Storage Groups are lists of directories that are used to hold MythTV
  recording files giving you a flexible way to allow you to add capacity
  to your MythTV system without having to use exotic solutions such as
  LVM, filesystem expansion or RAID Online Capacity Expansion.  You can
  also use Storage Groups to organize recordings and to put recordings
  of a certain type into one subdirectory.

  Storage Groups do not offer redundancy in case of hard drive failure,
  but unlike LVM, if you lose a hard drive, you only lose the recordings
  that were on that drive.  With LVM, if you lose a hard drive, you will
  most likely lose [1meverything[22m.


  [1m9.1.6.2.  How to use Storage Groups.[0m

  By default, there is only one Storage Group called "Default", and it
  is used for all recordings and Live TV.



       [1mNOTE[22m:  You need to add at least one directory to the Default
  Storage Group or else you will not be able to record anything with
  MythTV.

  For example, if you have 5 hard drives in your system, your first hard
  drive could be your "boot" drive, and the remaining four could be
  dedicated to media storage. You could format the drives and mount them
  as /mnt/store/d2, /mnt/store/d3, /mnt/store/d4 and /mnt/store/d5.

  Within each mount point, it's [4mstrongly[24m recommended that you use a sub-
  directory and make that the destination path for the Storage Group.
  See the ``Tip'' in the "Configuring the Master backend" section for
  additional information.


  You would then add the four subdirectories you created under the mount
  points (/mnt/store/d1/video, etc) into the "Default" Storage Group.

  At recording time, if there were four simultaneous recordings, MythTV
  would put one recording onto each drive.

  Or, say that you originally installed MythTV to a 80GB hard drive, and
  that hard drive is now filling up.  You could simply add a new drive
  to your system, mount it and update the Storage Group to add
  additional space.

  You may create additional Storage Groups to store specific recordings
  in their own directories.  Storage Groups are edited via the 'Storage
  Directories' section of mythtv-setup.

  You can also create multiple Storage Groups to group recordings
  together; recording schedules now have an option to specify which
  Storage Group to use.

  MythTV will balance concurrent recordings across the available
  directories in a Storage Group in order to spread out the file I/O
  load.  MythTV will prefer filesystems that are local to the backend
  over filesystems that are remote until the local filesystem has 2
  concurrent recordings active or other equivalent I/O, then the next
  recording will go to the remote filesystem.  The balancing method is
  based purely on I/O, Myth does not try to balance out disk space
  unless a filesystem is too low on free disk space in which case it
  will not be used except as a last resort.

  Storage Groups are global, but can be overridden on a slave backend by
  creating a local Storage Group by running [1mmythtv-setup [22mon the slave.
  If a problem occurs and the slave backend is unable to use the desired
  Storage Group, it will fail back and try the directories defined in
  the master's Storage Group.

  There's also a special 'LiveTV' Storage Group, but the directory list
  starts out empty.  If you add a directory to the Storage Group, it
  will be used instead of putting LiveTV recordings in the Default
  Storage Group.  This will allow you to put your LiveTV recordings on
  their own filesystem, which is similar to the old MythTV method which
  used a RingBuffer for LiveTV.  Of course, you don't have to do
  anything, and Live TV recordings will just go into the Default Storage
  Group where they'll be the first programs eligible for expiration if
  the system needs free space for recordings.

  Usage information for all Storage Group directories is visible on the
  mythfrontend status screen as well as the mythbackend status webpage.
  MythTV is smart enough to determine which directories are on shared
  filesystems so it should not count free or used space multiple times
  if you have more than one directory on the same filesystem.


  [1m9.1.6.3.  Migrating to Storage Groups.[0m

  Migrating to Storage groups is very simple:  if you have existing
  recordings in a storage directory, then the system will automatically
  add that directory to the Default Storage Group.  If you then add
  additional directories to a storage group, the system is flexible
  enough to check [4mall[24m Storage Groups for a file before deciding that it
  can't be found, which means that you can use the [1mmv [22mcommand from the
  Unix command line to arrange files however you'd like.



  [1m9.1.6.4.  Advanced: Algorithm used by the Storage Group[0m

  This section details the logic of the Storage Group allocation engine.

  The current load-balancing preferences (in order) are:

  +o  Local filesystems over remote

  +o  Less-busy (less weight) over more-busy (more weight)

  +o  More Free Space over Less Free Space

  The 'business' of a filesystem is determined by weights. The following
  weights are added to a filesystem if it is in use for the following
  things:

  +o  recording = +10

  +o  playback = +5 (mythfrontend)

  +o  comm flagging = +5 (mythcommflag)

  +o  transcoding = +5 (mythtranscode)

  If a recording is due to end within 3 minutes, it is not counted
  against the weight of a filesystem. This is done to account for the
  pre/post-roll and start-early/end-late settings.


  [1m9.2.  Post-configuration[0m

  Run the mythfilldatabase program as directed.  The master backend will
  obtain guide data for all the video sources you defined during setup.

  [1mNOTE[22m: If you are using Schedules Direct and watching the output
  messages on the console or the log file it is normal to see a "401
  Unauthorized" error followed by a "200 OK" when the connection to
  Schedules Direct is being established.

  Once mythfilldatabase has finished, start the master server before
  continuing.
       $ mythbackend



  mythbackend will print information about connections and what it's
  doing to the console.  If you'd like to see the options that are
  available for mythbackend, type mythbackend -h for help.

  As of MythTV v0.21, the available options are:


       $ mythbackend --help
       Valid options are:
       -h or --help                   List valid command line parameters
       -l or --logfile filename       Writes STDERR and STDOUT messages to filename
       -p or --pidfile filename       Write PID of mythbackend to filename
       -d or --daemon                 Runs mythbackend as a daemon
       -v or --verbose debug-level    Use '-v help' for level info
       --printexpire                  List of auto-expire programs
       --printsched                   Upcoming scheduled programs
       --testsched                    Test run scheduler (ignore existing schedule)
       --resched                      Force the scheduler to update
       --nosched                      Do not perform any scheduling
       --nojobqueue                   Do not start the JobQueue
       --noautoexpire                 Do not start the AutoExpire thread
       --version                      Version information



  Running mythbackend as a daemon and using the logfile option will
  allow you to have mythbackend automatically start up during boot.  You
  can follow the steps outlined in the section called ``Automatically
  starting mythbackend at system boot time'' for configuration steps.

  If you enable the -l parameter, you will want to keep your logfiles
  rotated (so that they don't fill up a partition).  See the section
  called ``Automatically rotating logs'' for more information.


  [1m9.3.  Configuring a non-master backend[0m

  Ensure that you've granted access to the master MySQL database for
  remote backends as discussed in the section titled ``Modifying access
  to the MySQL database for multiple systems'' and that you have the
  correct IP address for the database server in the "Database
  Configuration" screen of the mythtv-setup application on this slave
  backend.



             [1mNOTE[22m: Slave backends [1mmust not [22mrun a local MySQL
  daemon.  By default, they will connect to their local daemon rather
  than the central database, causing unexpected behavior such as empty
  "Watch Recordings" lists and a failure to locate the Video Sources
  defined on the master backend.  Modify the
  /usr/local/share/mythtv/mysql.txt file on all slave backends to ensure
  that the DBHostName has the address of the MySQL server.  Caveat:  You
  may make a slave backend the primary MySQL server, or run a non-MythTV
  database on a slave backend as long as you have edited the mysql.txt
  file on [1mall [22msystems and made it consistent. There can be only one
  authoritative MySQL database in a MythTV system - errors such as the
  one above ensue if backends and frontends have differing ideas of
  which MySQL database they should talk to.

  Make sure that the IP addresses on the General setup screen are
  accurate.  If the slave backend can't communicate with the master
  backend due to IP address misconfiguration then MythTV will not
  function properly.

  Configuration of a non-master backend follows the same general
  procedure as that of the master backend, with the exception that you
  skip over the "Video Sources" step.  All possible video sources need
  to be defined on the master backend system; only the master backend
  will query a listings provider to obtain guide data for all the non-
  master backends.

  [1m9.5.  Grabbing channel icons for Schedules Direct users[0m

  While the Schedules Direct TV listings service has several advantages,
  it does not support grabbing logo icons for the stations you receive.
  However, there are utilities provided with MythTV which you may use to
  grab your initial set of icons and to keep them updated if your
  lineups change.

  First, you need to generate or obtain an XML file with the information
  for your stations.

  If you have XMLTV software installed, there is a perl script in
  MythTV's contrib/ directory which will generate this file for you. Run
  the command:


       $ perl mkiconmap.pl



  You will be asked for your zip code and the service that you use. If
  there are no errors, the iconmap.xml file that you need for the next
  step will be created.

  If you do not have XMLTV software installed and do not want to install
  it for the sake of this minor task, there is a generic
  contrib/master_iconmap.xml which you can copy and use but this may not
  be as complete as using the specific information for your service.

  Once you have an iconmap.xml file, add the icon information to your
  database and grab any new icons with the command:


       $ mythfilldatabase --import-icon-map iconmap.xml --update-icon-map



  [1m10.  Configuring mythfrontend.[0m

  Once you have completed configuration of your backend systems, the
  next step is to configure the frontend client.

  When you start mythfrontend for the first time, it will attempt to
  connect to a configuration database on the local machine.  If there is
  none, a "Database Configuration" screen will appear, and you will need
  to fill in some details.  The "Host name" field needs the backend or
  database server's IP address or DNS name, and the User or password
  fields may need to be set to match your database user accounts.  After
  editing those fields, press Enter twice to write these configurations
  on your local machine, and attempt to connect to the database.  If you
  make any mistakes, the screens will pop up again.

  Now that mythfrontend has started up, you should have a number of
  buttons/choices.  Before doing anything, go to TV, then to Setup and
  configure the frontend client.



        [1mNOTE[22m:  You should go through the various setup screens in
  mythfrontend before using any other modules to ensure that the the
  database is correctly initialized.
  [1m10.1.  General[0m

  The General screen has configuration items that don't really fit
  anywhere else.  The first few configuration items ask you to indicate
  the number of seconds to record before or after a program, which is
  useful if the broadcast network or your system clock are out of sync
  and will help prevent you missing the beginning or end of a program.

  To change the value, use the left and right arrow keys to increment
  and decrement the number of seconds.  When you're satisfied with the
  result, use the down arrow to put the input focus on the Next button
  or press RETURN to continue to the next page.

  The next page has a number of options to do with how channels are
  displayed on your system.  The help text will give you more
  information.  Move the focus to Next and press the space bar to
  continue.

  The last General page sets up some final configuration items.  See the
  help text for more information.


  [1m10.2.  Appearance[0m

  This set of screens is mostly concerned with how MythTV will look on
  your system.  From here, you can choose different themes and set the
  resolution of your system.


  [1m10.3.  Program Guide[0m

  Fairly self explanatory.  Note that the alternate program guide does
  not use the same font settings as defined in Appearance, so if the EPG
  is unreadable this is where you make the adjustments to fonts, number
  of elements displayed, etc.


  [1m10.4.  Playback[0m

  The one configuration item which may cause problems on your system is
  the "Deinterlace playback" setting.  MythTV uses a linear blend
  algorithm for deinterlacing, which will improve how the image looks on
  your screen.  Deinterlacing requires that your processor support SSE.
  (Streaming SIMD Extensions, aka "MMX2").  Early Intel Celeron (those
  that don't use the Coppermine 0.18um core and are usually <600MHz),
  Pentium Pro and Pentium II CPUs do not have SSE, so make sure you
  haven't enabled deinterlacing if your processor doesn't support it. If
  you enable it, and your processor doesn't support SSE, you will get
  "Illegal Instruction" errors.

  To determine if you've got SSE on an Intel processor, you can:


       $ cat /proc/cpuinfo
       [snip]
       flags           : fpu vme de pse tsc msr pae mce cx8 apic sep mtrr pge mca
       cmov pat pse36 mmx fxsr sse



  Notice the [1msse [22mat the end of the line - this tells you that this
  processor will be able to deinterlace correctly.

  On an AMD processor, look for "3dnow" in the cpuinfo line; "3dnow" is
  AMD's implementation of SSE instructions, so if your processor has
  3dnow you shouldn't have any issues with deinterlacing.

  [1m10.4.1.  Video Filters[0m

  MythTV provides a means of employing video filters while recording and
  during playback. These filters can be used to improve or modify the
  video image, including hiding the effects of an interlaced image or
  reducing the impact of noise in a poor video signal. The following is
  a brief introduction to introduce you to the filters that are
  available in MythTV version 0.20 and higher.

  [1m10.4.2.  Applying filters[0m

  One or more filters can be included in a "filter chain". The filters
  to be used are identified in a "filter string". A filter string is a
  group of filter names and parameters separated by commas.  To include
  parameters, the filter name is followed by "=" and the parameter
  information. There should be no spaces in the filter string. Here is
  an example filter string:

  With parameters: kerneldeint=10:1,denoise3d=12

  Without: kerneldeint,denoise3d

  Recording filters are set for each individual channel. These may be
  used when encoding in software (MPEG-4, RTjpeg) but do not apply when
  using a capture card with hardware encoding such as those supported by
  the ivtv driver, DVB, HDTV or MJPEG cards. You can run MythTV's
  "setup" program and select the "Channel Editor". On the first page for
  each channel, you can enter a filter string in the box titled "Video
  filters". If you are running "mythweb" on your web server, you can
  click on "Settings" then "Channels" and enter filter strings in the
  "videofilters" column.

  Playback filters are per-host and apply to any recording you watch
  from the frontend where filters have been applied. Playback filtering
  can only work with software decoding so the viaslice, xvmc, and ivtv
  outputs ignore filters entirely. From "mythfrontend" go to Setup->TV
  Settings->Playback.  Enter your filter string in the box titled
  "Custom Filters".


  [1m10.4.3.  Currently Available Filters[0m

  "Deinterlace Playback" checkbox.

  This implements special behavior needed for the "bobdeint" filter but
  can also be used to choose any of the deinterlace filters. If you
  prefer, you may leave this unchecked and include any of the
  deinterlace filters, other than "bobdeint", in your custom filter
  chain.

  o The "invert" filter

  Invert ignores any parameters and inverts the pixel values of the
  video frames.  In other words, a negative image. This would rarely be
  useful but may be a good example to verify that your filter strings
  take effect.

  o The "linearblend" filter

  It is a simple deinterlacing filter that ignores parameters and works
  by blending adjacent lines.  It replaces combing in interlaced video
  with a less distracting "ghost" image.


  o The "bobdeint" filter

  This filter splits the interlaced image into two separate fields that
  can be line doubled then displayed at twice the frame rate. If the
  display is at the same refresh rate as the recording (59.92Hz NTSC or
  50Hz PAL) this will cause each refresh to show objects in motion in a
  new position with no jagged edges. However, if the display is not
  synchronous, it will cause flickering or the appearance of the picture
  moving up and down by one line.



         [1mNOTE[22m: This filter requires the frame rate to be doubled
  and therefore can only be used with the "Deinterlace Playback"
  checkbox.  Do not include this in your filter chain.

  o The "kerneldeint" filter

  Kerneldeint is a more complex deinterlacing filter which applies a
  filter kernel using input from several lines.  It generally removes
  combing without a "ghost" image, sometimes leaving a faint outline of
  the image from the other field. It is considered to be less
  distracting to watch than linearblend or no filter at all. It accepts
  one or two integer parameters separated by a colon.

  The first parameter is the filter threshold and defaults to 12.
  Adjacent lines differing by more than the threshold value are
  filtered. The second option defaults to 0.  If set to a non-zero
  value, it will cause the filter to skip chroma, and filter only the
  luminance.  It may be useful on some capture cards which do not
  capture the chroma fields of interlaced video correctly.

  o The "onefield" filter

  This is a simple one-field deinterlacing filter that uses only one
  field of the interlaced video.  By default it keeps the top field,
  though passing the parameter "bottom" will cause it to keep the bottom
  field instead.

  This filter is primarily useful for those who display 1080i HDTV
  signals with a video mode that has 540 pixels vertically.  The
  advantage over other deinterlacing filters is that scenes with motion
  never show combing or ghosting.

  o The "adjust" filter

  This filter adjusts the digital values for luma and chroma to ensure
  that they will fall within the ranges specified in the ITU-R601
  standard. By default, this corrects a known problem for the luma range
  used by bt8x8 chips which causes video to look washed out. If
  parameters are passed, there need to be exactly six. However, passing
  a single parameter of "-1" will disable the filter.

  1: luma minimum input value (int) 2: luma maximum input value (int) 3:
  luma gamma correction (float) 4: chroma minimum input value (int) 5:
  chroma maximum input value (int) 6: chroma gamma correction (float)

  The default bt8x8 correction values are equivalent to
  "16:253:1.0:2:253:1.0".  Output ranges are fixed at ITU-R601 values
  (16-235 luma, 16-240 chroma).

  [1mNOTE[22m: If it is not already specified in the filter chain, this filter
  will be automatically applied when recording with the "bttv" driver.
  o The "quickdnr" filter

  A fast temporal denoiser. This can take 1, 2 or 4 parameters, each
  being a value from "0" for the least filtering to "255" for the
  greatest filtering.  With one parameter, the filter will compute the
  values it should use for all of its variables. Two parameters will set
  the filter strength for luma and chroma independently. If you are
  interested in how the algorithm works, you may examine the source code
  to see how four parameter are used.

  o The "denoise3d" filter

  A slower denoiser that applies a spatial and temporal low-pass filter.
  The spatial filter can remove some noise that quickdnr can't, but a
  more powerful CPU is needed.  This filter accepts 3 float parameters:


  +o  luma spatial filter strength

  +o  chroma spatial filter strength

  +o  luma temporal filter strength

  Reasonable defaults will be selected for omitted parameters.  The
  chroma temporal filter strength is calculated from the other filter
  strengths.

  o The "crop" filter

  Covers edges of video with black bars.  This helps improve video
  quality when the edges of the frame are distorted. By default, this
  removes 16 pixels from each edge. This can optionally take four
  parameters representing top:left:bottom:right. The number times 16 is
  the number of pixels to remove so, for example, the default is
  "=1:1:1:1".

  o The "forceyv12" and "forceyuv422p" filters

  These force the filter manager to use the given format.  You can use
  one of these at the head of a filter chain to change the capture
  format. The most likely use would be forceyuv422p to use YUV422P
  capture on cards with known chroma interlacing problems with YV12.

  There are some filters included in the MythTV source code that should
  not be used:

  o The "forcergb24" and "forceargb32" filters

  The two RGB formats should not be used because there is no conversion
  filter for them yet.

  o The "convert" filter

  It exists but don't use it.  The filter manager uses this filter
  automatically when it is unable to match the input/output formats of
  two adjacent filters.

  o The "postprocess" filter

  While this exists in MythTV source code, it is currently not
  recommended for use.



  [1m10.4.4.  Usage Considerations[0m

  There are trade-offs to consider when deciding if it would be wise to
  use a filter. Any processing will modify the original image so you
  should assess if the filter has made a noticeable improvement to the
  picture in order to justify the impact of the processing.  Adding any
  filter will inherently increase CPU usage. The impact can vary
  dramatically depending on your CPU type and speed, the resolution of
  the recording, which filters you are using and other factors. You can
  only determine what is right for you through experimentation. However,
  as a starting point, here are some filter strings that you may find
  useful:

  For typical broadcast stations: "kerneldeint,quickdnr"

  For stations with poor signal quality: "linearblend,denoise3d=12"

  For synchronous TV-out: check Deinterlace with "Bob (2x framerate)"


  [1m10.5.  Recording[0m

  Depending on your capture card, MythTV offers different video
  encoders.  The following types of hardware encoding cards are
  supported:

  +o  MJPEG - Zoran-based cards; see http://mjpeg.sourceforge.net
     <http://mjpeg.sourceforge.net>

  +o  MPEG-2 - iTVC15/16 based cards (Hauppauge PVR-250/PVR-350); see
     http://ivtvdriver.org <http://ivtvdriver.org>

  +o  HDTV - pcHDTV cards; see http://pchdtv.com <http://pchdtv.com> and
     the Air2PC-ATSC-PCI see
     http://www.cyberestore.com/product_info.php?cPath=28&products_id=103
     <http://www.cyberestore.com/product_info.php?cPath=28&products_id=103>

  +o  DVB - cards supporting DVB; see http://linuxtv.org
     <http://linuxtv.org>

     For cards without hardware encoding capabilities (all cards
     supported by V4L not listed above), Myth includes two methods for
     software encoding: RTjpeg and MPEG-4.  RTjpeg has significantly
     fewer CPU demands than MPEG-4, but it generates larger files than
     MPEG-4 for a given recording.

  For DVB and HDTV cards, no further configuration is required after
  setting up the card using the 'mythtv-setup' program.  For all other
  cards, configuration is done through MythFrontend.  Selecting
  'Recording Profiles' from the 'TV Settings' screen will list the
  profiles currently available for the cards in your system.  Depending
  on what types of cards you have installed you may see:


       (Create new profile group)
       Software Encoders
       Hardware MPEG Encoders
       Hardware MJPEG Encoders
       Transcoders



  The '(Create new profile group)' option will allow you to create cus-
  tom profiles in case you have multiple backends.  Note that custom
  profiles are per backend and card type.  If you have 2 MPEG-2 encoders
  in a given backend system, creating a custom profile will affect both
  of them.  This option should not be needed otherwise.

  The 'Transcoders' group is a little different from the others.
  Selecting this group will result in a menu with the following options:
  'RTjpeg/MPEG-4' and 'MPEG-2'.  These types indicate what transcoder
  options will be used for a given input type (i.e. the 'MPEG-2'
  settings would be used to transcode MPEG-2 files into MPEG-4.  The
  source of the MPEG-2 stream (DVB, HDTV, or PVR-x50) does not matter.
  Configuration of the options is the same as below (although any
  resolution settings will be ignored).

  Selecting any of the other options will show a new screen with a list
  of four profiles:

  +o  Default

  +o  Live TV

  +o  Low Quality

  +o  High Quality

  The Default profile will be used for any recording which does not
  otherwise have a specific profile assigned. The 'Live TV' profile will
  be used when watching TV.  The remaining two profiles are available
  for customizing to allow for more precise control over what quality is
  used for a given program.

  Selecting a profile will allow you to adjust the relevant options for
  that card.  The most significant setting is the recording resolution,
  but you can also choose encoding format, audio format, and tweak other
  encoder specific properties.



       [1mNOTE[22m: although the width and height can be changed to almost
  anything, if you start MythTV and don't see video or you get
  "segmentation fault" errors, it is likely that the video4linux (v4l)
  subsystem did not like the height and width parameters specified.
  It's best to leave the default as-is until you're sure that MythTV is
  operational.

  See the ``What capture resolution should I use? How does video work?''
  section for more information.


  [1m10.6.  Xbox Frontends[0m

  MythTV is able to control the LED on the Xbox to indicate backend
  recording status.

  To control the LED, you will need the [1mblink [22mprogram from the xbox-
  linux project, which is installed as /bin/led on GentooX.  On Xebian
  (the new Ed's Debian) you must install it yourself.  On other
  distributions it may or may not be installed as a program called [1mblink[0m
  and should be located in your path.  (Type which blink to see if the
  program is available.) If you do not have [1mblink[22m, you may obtain it
  from the Xbox-Linux project site at http://xbox-linux.sf.net/
  <http://xbox-linux.sf.net/>. The program you need is part of the
  eds_i2c_staff module in CVS.  Note the spelling.


  Once you have installed [1mblink [22myou will need to set permissions.  [1mblink[0m
  needs write permission to the i2c device to function properly.  There
  are three methods to accomplish this.  First, you could run
  mythfrontend as root, which is the simplest method, but could
  potentially be a security risk.  Next, you may make the [1mblink [22mbinary
  setuid root, which allows non-privileged users to run a program with
  root capability.  This is done by typing the command:


       $ su
       # chmod u+s /path/to/blink



  The final technique would be to set the /dev/i2c/0 device read/write
  for all users, but this is the least preferred method.

  Now it's time to setup MythTV for Xbox hardware.  Enter Setup ->
  General.  On the second page check the 'Enable Xbox Hardware' option.
  Upon reentering the settings, you should have a new option named
  'Xbox'.  Within this option you may select the distribution, LED
  colors for recording and the update interval.  If you select GentooX
  as the distribution [1mled [22mwill be used as the [1mblink [22mbinary name,
  otherwise, [1mblink [22mis used.  Colors should be self explanatory.  The
  update interval determines how often the frontend should poll the
  backend to determine if the status has changed.

  cause mythfrontend to obscure the video. KDE does not seem to have any
  such issues. Therefore you will need to switch to KDE by selecting
  RedHatMenu>Extras>System Settings>Desktop Switching Tool and choose

  [1m11.4.  Adding support for an external tuner[0m

  MythTV supports changing the channel on an external tuner.  If you
  have an external tuner, such as a DirecTV or digital cable set top
  box, you should add /usr/local/bin/changechannel to your Input
  Connections in the mythbackend configuration GUI.

  However, there is not [1mchangechannel [22mprogram per-se, because this is
  going to be dependent on what sort of external tuner you have.  Look
  in the contrib/channel_changers directory for a number of programs and
  scripts which may be used to change channels.  Once you find one which
  works, copy it to /usr/local/bin/changechannel.

  Feel free to browse some of what sort of hardware is available at

  [1m11.5.  Using Shutdown/Wakeup[0m

  What does the MythTV Shutdown/Wakeup function do? The scheduler on the
  Master backend (MBE) keeps track of the idle status of the entire
  MythTV system, including the Slave backends (SBE). If it considers the
  system to be idle, and thus ready to shutdown, it sets the wakeuptime
  to the time of the next recording and then proceeds to shut down all
  Slave backends and then itself. Once it is time to begin recording,
  the Master backend and the Slave Backends are automatically woken up.
  This system allows MythTV to record like a normal VCR, thereby
  conserving power when not in active use.

  In order to use the Shutdown/Wakeup function there must be some method
  of waking up the Master backend.  There are any number of solutions,
  but we will discuss in detail two possibilities:


  +o  Use another server that runs 24/7 and have it send a WakeOnLAN
     (WOL) packet to wake the Master backend.  This assumes that you
     have the WOL tools installed, and that your Master backend
     motherboard supports WOL.

  +o  Use your motherboard's BIOS wakeup capability.  You'll need a
     motherboard that supports BIOS wakeup, and some tools.  Two that
     work are: http://sourceforge.net/projects/nvram-wakeup
     <http://sourceforge.net/projects/nvram-wakeup> and
     http://www.malloc.de/tools/wakeup_clock.html
     <http://www.malloc.de/tools/wakeup_clock.html>


  [1m11.5.1.  A deeper look into the operation[0m

  The scheduler keeps track of the idle status of the MythTV system. To
  determine whether or not the MythTV system is idle, the following
  conditions must be met for a period of time defined in the "Idle
  timeout (secs)" parameter.


  +o  no client is connected to the server

  +o  no recording (neither LiveTV nor a regular recording) is currently
     taking place

  +o  no recording starts within a definable amount of time ("Max. wait
     for recording (min)")

  +o  the "pre Shutdown check-command" returns 0

  If we get to this idle state the Master backend will set the
  wakeuptime using the "Set wakeuptime command", which is the same for
  WOL and BIOS wakeup. The Master backend will then shut down the Slave
  backends and itself using the "Server halt command".

  One caveat is that the scheduler tries to guess if the Master backend
  was started by a wakeup call or by the user. If it thinks it was woken
  up by a user, it blocks shutdown until a client connects to the Master
  backend, after which it will behave as described above. To disable
  this feature, unset "Block shutdown before client connected" in the
  mythfrontend Setup->Setup->General screen.

  Once it is time to startup the system, the Master backend is woken up
  first and will wakeup the Slave backends using the "Wake command for
  slaves". At this time, there is no support for starting only the
  required Slave backend, so all Slave backends will startup.


  [1m11.5.2.  Setting up the MythTV side of this extension.[0m

  There are a number of options that are used to control the Shutdown /
  Wakeup feature.

  Shutdown/Wakeup Options:

  +o  "Idle timeout (secs)" is the time the server waits while idle until
     a shutdown occurs.

  +o  "Max. wait for recording (min)" is the time the Master backend
     waits for a recording without shutting down. For example, this
     would be used to prevent a 10 minute system shutdown if a recording
     is set to start 15 minutes from now.

  +o  "Startup before rec. (secs)" Sets how long before a programmed
     recording the MythTV system will be woken up.  This should be
     roughly be the time your systems need to bootup, and if you have
     Slave backends, you'll need to ensure this value is long enough for
     all your machines to perform their bootup cycle.

  +o  "Wakeup time format" is the format of the wakeup time that is given
     in the "Set wakeuptime command" as a parameter "$time". You need to
     set this according to your wakeup mechanism. If you need seconds
     since the epoch (1970-01-01) set the "Wakeup time format" to
     "time_t".

  +o  "Set wakeuptime command" is the command executed to set the new
     wakeuptime.

  +o  "Server Halt Command" is the command executed to shutdown the
     Master backend and the Slave backends.

  +o  "pre Shutdown check-command" is used to give a "Go/NO-GO" decision
     from a non-MythTV source.  This command is executed immediately
     before the shutdown would occur. The return value is use to make
     the following choices:

     +o  If it returns a "0" the shutdown will occur as scheduled.

     +o  If it returns a "1" the "idle timeout" will be reset and the
        system waits again for the timeout.

     +o  If it returns a "2" the entire shutdown sequence is reset.  This
        means that a new client connect is needed before a shutdown
        occurs, unless you have the "Wait for client connect" setting
        disabled, in which case this is the same as returning "1".  An
        example of a use for this return value is to prevent the
        shutdown if a user is currently logged in, or if a specific
        program (i.e. transcode, automatic updates, etc.) is currently
        running. If you don't need it, leave the field blank.

  The "WakeOnLan settings": These settings have nothing to do with using
  BIOS or WOL wakeup, they are the same for both.

  +o  "Master backend" This setting defines timings for the frontends to
     wakeup the Master backend using WOL. Useful if your frontend can
     emit a WOL packet so you don't need to physically go to the Master
     backend if you're trying to watch TV.

  +o  "Reconnect wait time (secs)" is the time the frontend waits after
     executing the "Wake command" before attempting to retry the
     connection. This should be roughly the amount of time your Master
     backend needs for bootup.  Set to "0" to disable. The frontends
     will retry to connect for "Count of reconnect tries" times before
     giving up.

  +o  "Wake command for slaves" is the [4mone[24m command executed to wake your
     Slave backends. This should be a script that contains the calls to
     wakeup all Slave backend systems.


  [1m11.5.2.1.  Using WOL to wake your Master backend.[0m

  To use WOL to wake your Master backend you will need a WOL capable
  Master backend, a machine that runs 24/7 which can execute an at-job
  and nc (netcat) on the Master backend. I use some little bash scripts
  to make my DSL router wakeup my mythbox if required.

  Replace $SERVER and $PORT with your own settings!  On my Master
  backend I have a script that gets called as 'setwakeuptime command'
  which looks like the following:


       #! /bin/sh
       echo $@ | nc $SERVER $PORT



  This simply cats the parameters (that is $time) to my 24/7 server. On
  my $SERVER I have (x)inetd listening on $PORT starting a little script
  which cares about setting the at-job. The following additions are nec-
  essary on the $SERVER:

  If you use [1minetd[22m:

  In /etc/inetd.conf add:


       mythwake stream tcp nowait mythtv /usr/sbin/tcpd /usr/local/bin/mythwake



  If you use [1mxinetd[22m, save the following as [1mmythwake [22min your
  /etc/xinet.d/ directory:


       service mythwake
         {
               socket_type     = stream
               wait            = no
               user            = mythtv
               protocol        = tcp
               id              = mythwake
               server          = /usr/local/bin/mythwake
         }



  and add the following to /etc/services:


       mythwake        $PORT/tcp



  Finally, /usr/local/bin/mythwake looks like:


       #! /bin/bash
       #this should be a command to wake your server
       WAKECMD="#!/bin/sh\n /usr/local/bin/wakeMBE"
       #first we need to delete all wake jobs in queue
       for JOB in atq | cut -f 1 ; do
           atrm $JOB;
       done
       #now we read the date from 'nc'
       read date;
       #now set the atjob
       echo -e "$WAKECMD" | at $date ;

  [1m11.5.2.2.  Using BIOS wakeup to wake your Master backend.[0m

  Since I don't use this, I cannot say much about this. If your
  motherboard supports any wakeup tool you have to call that tool as
  "Set wakeuptime command" with the "Wakeup time format" suitable for
  that tool.

  [1m11.5.3.  Wakeup the MySQL server using WOL[0m

  If your MySQL server and your Master backend are not on the same
  machine, you can have the Master backend wake your MySQL server using
  WOL. You will find the settings for this in the second page of the
  mythtv-setup program, or at the end of mysql.txt.  The meanings are
  the same as discussed in "The WakeOnLan settings" above.



  [1m11.5.4.  Tips/Tricks:[0m

  If, for example, one of the Slave backends is also your desktop
  computer, you could simply use a little script as 'server halt
  command' which first calls /sbin/shutdown -t TIMEOUT where TIMEOUT is
  a value sufficient for you to react.  You could then popup a window
  using *dialog, asking for permission to shutdown. If you cancel the
  shutdown, simply call /sbin/shutdown -c.

  If you get "nvram-wakeup: /dev/rtc: Device or resource busy" your set-
  wakeuptime-script should stop the program that uses /dev/rtc before
  setting the wakeuptime.

  [1m12.  Scheduling Recordings.[0m

  The MythTV master backend is responsible for managing the schedule for
  all TV tuner cards on the master and any slave. Its job is to search
  the TV listing for the shows you have requested and assign recordings
  to the TV tuner cards. If none of the shows that you've chosen
  overlap, it simply records all of them. However, if there are shows
  where the beginning and end times overlap, the scheduler follows rules
  that you've specified or makes logical decisions about what would be
  best if you haven't expressed your preference. Further, the "Upcoming
  Recordings" page allows you make specific decisions about what you
  really do and don't want to record.


  [1m12.1.  Record Types[0m

  When you choose a show that you would like to record from the Options
  Page, there are eight different types of rules to help the scheduler
  find which showings you would like to record.


  +o  Single Record -- record only this title at this specific time and
     this station. This is the best way to be sure that a certain
     showing will be recorded. However, if the TV listings change and
     the show is not broadcast at that time, the show will not be
     recorded but will be marked as Not Listed to let you know that you
     should investigate.

  +o  Find One -- this will record a title once from any of the times
     that appear in the TV listings. This is useful for recording a
     movie or special that has multiple showings because it allows the
     scheduler to choose one that doesn't conflict. It is not a good
     choice for recording a single episode of a series because it
     records the first available showing of the title without regard to
     the episode information.

  +o  Record Weekly -- this records a show whenever the title is listed
     on the same channel, weekday and time. Note that if the TV station
     changes the schedule for a special episode, it would not be
     recorded. However, you can add a Single record for the special
     episode. If there are no matching showings in the TV listings, a
     Not Listed item will be added to your schedule for the next time
     slot to let you know that you should investigate.

  +o  Find Weekly -- this will record a title once per week from any of
     the times that appear in the TV listings beginning from the time of
     the showing that was selected when the rule was set. This is useful
     for news, current events or other programs where the same episode
     is shown several times each week but the listings may not include
     descriptive information. This may not be a good choice if there are
     different episodes shown during the week.

  +o  Record Daily -- this records a show whenever the title is listed
     for the time and station on any day of the week. Here again, a show
     will not be recorded if the time was altered by the station. If
     there are no matching showings in the TV listings, a Not Listed
     item will be added to your schedule for the next time slot to let
     you know that you should investigate.

  +o  Find Daily -- this will record a title once per day from any of the
     times that appear in the TV listings beginning from the time of the
     showing that was selected when the rule was set. This is useful for
     news, current events or other programs where the same episode is
     shown several times each day but the listings may not include
     descriptive information. This may not be a good choice if there are
     different episodes shown during the day.

  +o  Channel Record -- records one showing of each unique episode from
     any of the times the title is listed on this station.  This is
     perhaps the most common rule to use for most shows.
  +o  Record All -- records one showing of each unique episode from any
     of the times this title is listed on any channel. This can be
     useful if a station has sister stations where shows are rebroadcast
     allowing the scheduler to record rebroadcasts on the other station
     when the original airing cannot be recorded.


  [1m12.2.  Scheduling Options[0m

  [1m12.2.1.  Priority[0m

  By default, all shows you select have equal value to the scheduler.
  There are a set of rules to make good choices when two or more shows
  are in conflict. However, priority values let the scheduler know what
  you prefer so that it can set the schedule based on your preferences.

  Initially, recording rule priority values are set to zero. You may
  choose to leave everything at "0" and let the scheduler follow rules
  to guess what you might prefer when there are conflicts. However, if
  you have one or two favorite shows, you may want to increase the
  priority value so the scheduler will know that you would prefer
  recording these over other shows. You might use certain values to rate
  shows so that all favorites are 2. good shows are 1 and extra 'filler'
  shows are all -1 for example. You could sort each title on the "Set
  Priorities" page to have a unique value so the scheduler can know
  which show you'd prefer versus any other show. The choice and style
  are entirely up to you. However, the more information you give to the
  scheduler, the more likely it will make the choices you would prefer
  in the first place.

  The scheduler choices are based on the total priority for a showing by
  adding up all priority factors that match the showing. By default,
  most of these factors are "0" but you may use any combination to
  express your likes and needs.


  +o  Per record rule -- this is the "priority" selection in the
     "Scheduling Options" section of the options page and this value is
     included for any showings that match the recording rule.  You may
     choose to only use these values and not use the other factors for
     the sake of simplicity and clarity.

  +o  Per record type -- Setup->TV Settings->Recording
     Priorities->General allows you to add to the priority based on the
     type. It may make sense to increase the value for "Single" so that
     by default they have an extra advantage over other shows. The
     default is +1. You may want to decrease the value for Find rules so
     that they will be less likely to interfere with regularly scheduled
     shows and will be more likely to record in a non-conflicting time
     instead.  The default is -1.

  +o  Per channel -- Setup->TV Settings->Recording Priorities->Channel
     Priorities can be useful if you believe that you prefer any of the
     shows on certain channels. This would give all shows on a channel
     an advantage by default.

  +o  Input priority -- in the "mythtv-setup" program, the "Input
     Connections" section allows you to add additional priority in the
     "Input priority".  This is simply another priority factor but has
     an interesting effect. If a card input has a higher value than the
     other cards, the scheduler will see that you would rather record
     showings of episodes on this input rather than a showing on other
     inputs. If you have multiple cards of different quality, you may
     want to set input priority to encourage the scheduler to record
     shows on your best card(s) whenever possible. This can also be
     useful if you have multiple video sources which include the same
     stations. For example, with digital and analog cable you could
     increase the digital cable input preference by 1 to tell the
     scheduler that you want to record from the digital channel whenever
     possible but the channel on the analog input could still be used
     when the digital input is busy.

  +o  Custom Priority -- this allows you to add any specialized factors
     you would like in order to influence scheduling decisions. See the
     ``Custom Priority'' section below.

     For any single showing of any show you've chosen to record, these
     factors are added together to find the "total priority". This is
     the priority that the scheduler uses to decide which showings are
     given the first choice when filling in the schedule.

  The scheduling priority of a show may also be used to determine auto-
  expiration of recordings when disk space gets full (see ``Auto-
  Expire'', below).


  [1m12.2.2.  Duplicates[0m

  Singles will record without regard to duplicate matching.


  The standard recurring methods of All, Channel, Weekly and Daily use
  the descriptive information in the TV listings to try to record only
  one showing of each unique episode. However, This goal is sometimes
  complicated by the fact that the stations may not include a
  description for a specific episode but use a generic description for
  the series instead. When there is a generic description, the default
  behavior is to assume that it may be an episode that you have not seen
  and to record it for you.  One of the duplicate matching options is
  "Record new episodes only".  If this is selected, listing that have an
  original air date of more than 14 days earlier are considered repeats
  and are not eligible to record. Generally, generic episodes will be
  marked as repeats also.


  Because of generic episodes and other situations, MythTV offers an
  alternative approach where shows may be recorded by choosing from
  multiple showings even when the descriptive information is not
  reliable. All of the "Find" record types look for matching titles in
  the listings. If there is a showing with specific episode information
  and that episode has recorded before, that showing is marked as
  previously or currently recorded. The scheduler will then choose to
  record the earliest non-conflicting showing from any of other
  remaining showings regardless of the descriptive information.
  Generally, Find One is most useful for movies or specials and the Find
  Daily and Find Weekly rules are best for news or current events shows
  that are repeated. However, these may be useful in other situations
  where the standard recording rules may not work correctly.


  [1m12.2.3.  Conflicts[0m

  As you add more shows that you would like to record, the scheduler
  will eventually encounter conflicts. If there are two shows at the
  same time and you have two or more TV tuner cards, both shows will
  record. However, if there are more shows than cards, the scheduler
  will have to decide what it thinks it should not record based on the
  information you have given. If you see an unexpected situation you are
  not "stuck" with the scheduler's choice. You can still tell the
  scheduler exactly which shows you do want to record and/or don't want
  to record in any situation.

  [1m12.2.4.  Scheduling decisions[0m

  Here are the actual decisions made by the scheduler as it fills in the
  schedule.


  +o  Currently recording beats not currently recording -- A recording in
     progress can not be moved to another input or time so it "wins" its
     current timeslot.

  +o  Single, Daily, or Weekly rules with no match are marked Not Listed
     -- If these or Overrides do not match the current listings because
     the listings have changed, they are added to the schedule and
     marked to indicate that they will not record.

  +o  Rules that could record beat rules that can not record a showing --
     If two rules match the same showing of a program, a rule marked as
     inactive or a showing marked as a repeat, for example, yield to the
     other rule.

  +o  More specific record type is used in place of less specific -- If
     two rules match the same showing of a program, preference is given
     to Don't Record then Override, Single, Find One, Record Weekly,
     Find Weekly, Record Daily, Find Daily, Channel and finally All.

  +o  Higher total priority beats lower total priority -- This is the
     core of the scheduling process. Episodes of the highest priority
     show are placed on the first available input followed by the next
     highest priority show and so on.

  +o  Future start time beats past start time -- If there is an episode
     in progress and also a later showing of the same episode, it is
     better to record the complete episode. If there isn't another
     showing, it will start recording immediately to record the
     remaining portion. This should only happen if you add a new rule
     while the show is in progress or if the master backend is started
     after the start time of a scheduled show.

  +o  More specific record type beats less specific record type -- If two
     shows are on at the same time and have the same total priority but
     different types they will be sorted by Single then Find One, Record
     Weekly, Find Weekly, Record Daily, Find Daily, Channel and finally
     All. This only applies if the priorities are the same.

  +o  If both start times have passed, later start time beats earlier
     start time -- This attempts to miss the least amount of time.

  +o  If neither start time has passed, earlier start time beats later
     start time -- This helps assure that the earliest showing of an
     episode has the advantage.

  +o  Lower input id beats higher input id -- The scheduler fills in open
     time slots on the first available input for the video source. The
     next input is used when there is another show already placed for
     the card of the first input.

  +o  Older record rule beats newer record rule -- If two shows are still
     equal after all of these other checks, the show whose record rule
     was added first is preferred over a more recent addition.

  +o  Postpone showings to resolve conflicts -- If Reschedule Higher
     Priorities is set or if a conflict has the same priority as a show
     that was scheduled at the same time, the scheduler will check to
     see if a scheduled show can be moved to another input or later
     matching showing without creating a new conflict so that the
     conflicting show can be scheduled to record.
  [1m12.2.5.  Reschedule Higher Priorities[0m

  Setup->TV Settings->Recording Priorities->General has a checkbox for
  "Reschedule Higher Priorities" which tells the scheduler to try to be
  a little smarter in certain situations. If this is checked, the
  scheduler will look for situations where a show cannot record because
  all inputs for the channel are used for higher priority shows. It will
  check to see if any of the other shows could be recorded at another
  time so that the conflicting show can be recorded in its place.

  Generally, this is a good strategy but there are tradeoffs. If a
  higher priority show is postponed, you will not get to watch it until
  it is recorded in the later timeslot. There is also a risk that the TV
  listings may change and the later showing may go away. In this rare
  case the higher priority show may never record. On the other hand, if
  you do not use this option you will miss recording some lower priority
  shows unnecessarily unless you manually make similar changes.

  By using Reschedule Higher Priorities, the scheduler will do a better
  job of recording as many of your shows as possible when left
  unattended. It will also be easy to see that shows have been marked to
  record at a later time.  You can then decide for yourself when you
  would prefer to record the first showing by clicking "Record anyway".


  [1m12.2.6.  Controlling Your Schedule[0m

  The Manage Recordings->Upcoming Recordings page is your control center
  for the MythTV scheduler. Unlike other DVR systems, this one page
  gives you all of the information and tools you need to see all of your
  alternatives and make whatever adjustments you desire.

  The upper half of the screen has a scrollable box listing items that
  match your record rules sorted by time. The lower half shows the
  details for the highlighted item. There are two 'views' available.
  Press "1" to include all of the items that match record rules even if
  they do not need to be recorded. Press "2" to focus on just the things
  that will record and items that may need your attention. The message
  in the upper right-hand corner will remind you when there are
  conflicts that would prevent one or more shows from being recorded.

  The items in the list are colored in the record color for things that
  will record, white for things that may need attention, gray for those
  that do not need to record and yellow when there is a time conflict.
  Items at the top of the list may also be highlighted indicating that
  the recording is in progress.

  Along with the channels, start times and titles, the right-hand column
  has a status code. Numbers indicate which card number has been
  assigned to record the show. Letters are used to indicate the reason
  that something will not be recorded. Just below the box is a short
  status message for the highlighted item that indicates the type of
  record rule that was matched, the "total priority" for this showing
  and a one or two word explanation of the status code. If you press
  SELECT, you will see more information about the status.

  There are a few status codes that may require your attention. "C"
  indicates that there are more overlapping shows to record than there
  are TV tuners to record them. "L" indicates that the scheduler found
  that it may be better to record a later showing of this episode. These
  states happen as a result of your choices and should normally reflect
  your preferences. However, you may notice situations where you would
  like to modify the scheduler's initial choices.

  The first thing you can do is to highlight an item and press INFO to
  see the recording options page. From this page you can change the
  record rule type, the duplicate matching rules, or raise or lower the
  priority to resolve whatever problem you noticed.

  Additionally, you can treat any individual showing as an exception
  that you do want to record or don't want to record. To use these
  "override" features, highlight the item and press SELECT. You will see
  a message explaining the current status and at least an "OK" button to
  exit without making changes.

  For items scheduled to record, there will be a button for "Don't
  record" which will prevent recording this showing but will still allow
  the same episode to record in the future. If there is episode
  description information, you may also see a button for "Never record".
  This prevents recording this showing and tells MythTV to remember that
  this is an episode that you've seen or don't need to see if it is ever
  in the TV listings again.

  For items that are not scheduled to record, the message will describe
  the reason and in the case of "C" or "L" it will include a list of the
  shows that are scheduled to record instead. For any item that could
  potentially be recorded there will be buttons for "Edit Options" and
  "Add Override". "Edit Options" will allow you to change the options
  for the existing record rule such as raising the priority so that the
  show will record. These changes would apply to this and all future
  showings that match this record rule.  "Add Override" will allow you
  to set options that apply to the specific showing without affecting
  the recurring record rule.

  If you return to an override page after an override has already been
  set, you will also see a "Clear Override" to undo your changes. This
  option makes it very easy to try out some "what if" attempts when
  deciding on your best strategy in a difficult situation.

  For a recording in progress, there will be a "Change Ending Time"
  button.  This will take you to the options page for a Single or
  Override or create an Override if it is a recurring rule. Here you can
  go to the Recording Options section to change the program end time
  offset. If you extend the end time so that it overlaps upcoming
  recordings, the schedule will change to accommodate the new end time.
  This may cause a conflict or later showing even for a show with higher
  priority. Therefore, it is a good idea to check your schedule after
  changing the end time of a recording in progress.


  [1m12.3.  Storage Options[0m

  [1m12.3.1.  Recording Profile[0m

  Each recording rule can be configured with a different recording
  profile.  For example, colorful cinematography can be configured with
  a "High Quality" profile, while 'talking heads' interviews shows can
  be configured with a "Low Quality" profile. These recording profiles
  need to be configured before using them (see ``Recording'', above).


  [1m12.3.2.  Recording Group[0m

  For organization of the "Watch Recordings" screen and the MythWeb
  interface, recordings can be assigned into "recording groups".


  [1m12.3.3.  ``Storage Groups''[0m

  This allows you to select any special "Storage Groups" you may have
  created to determine where recordings from this rule should be stored
  on your disks. The "Default" storage group is always available.
  [1m12.3.4.  Playback Group[0m

  This selects a set of pre-configured playback parameters which can be
  created and edited in Setup->TV Settings->Playback Groups.  When the
  recording is played, the values from this playback group will be used.
  This allows you to choose a default time stretch value, skip and jump
  amounts appropriate for this type of television program.


  [1m12.3.5.  Auto-Expire[0m

  MythTV will "autoexpire" old recordings to make room for new
  recordings when disk space gets filled up. This option can be set to
  "Don't allow auto expire" to prevent these recordings from being
  automatically deleted when disk space fills up.


  The default setting is for all scheduled recordings to be eligible for
  auto-expiration; this can be changed in the Settings->TV
  Settings->General page by manipulating the "Auto Expire Default"
  checkbox.


  The default auto-expire policy is "Oldest Show First"; the oldest
  recordings are deleted first. The "Lowest Priority First" method
  chooses to expire the lowest-priority recordings first.


  [1m12.3.6.  Episode Limit[0m

  An episode limit can also be configured to limit the maximum number of
  episodes recorded of a single series, to restrict that series' disk
  usage. If this is set, you can further decide what to do when this
  limit is reached; either stop recording that series, or to delete the
  oldest episodes in favor of the new ones.


  [1m12.4.  Post Recording Processing[0m

  [1m12.4.1.  Commercial Flagging[0m

  Select whether or not to automatically flag commercials for these
  recordings. Commercial Flagging parameters can be set in Setup->TV
  Settings->General.


  [1m12.4.2.  Transcoding[0m

  Select whether or not to automatically transcode recordings to save
  disk space. Before using this, you must first enable auto-transcode in
  the recording profile and configure the transcoding parameters; see
  ``Recording'', above.


  [1m12.4.3.  User Jobs[0m

  User Jobs allow you to configure up to 4 custom commands to run on
  recordings. They can be configured in mythtv-setup. The following
  tokens have special meaning when used in the User Job commands:


  +o  %DIR% - the directory component of the recording's filename

  +o  %FILE% - the filename component of the recording's filename


  +o  %TITLE% - the title of the recording (e.g., name of the series)

  +o  %SUBTITLE% - the subtitle of the recording (e.g., name of the
     episode)

  +o  %DESCRIPTION% - description text for the recording (from guide
     data)

  +o  %HOSTNAME% - the backend making the recording

  +o  %CATEGORY% - the category of the recording (from guide data)

  +o  %RECGROUP% - the ``recording group''

  +o  %CHANID% - the MythTV channel ID making the recording

  +o  %STARTTIME% - the recording start time (YYYYMMDDhhmmss)

  +o  %ENDTIME% - the recording end time (YYYYMMDDhhmmss)

  +o  %STARTTIMEISO% - the recording start time in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-
     MM-DDTHH:MM:SS)

  +o  %ENDTIMEISO% - the recording end time in ISO 8601 format

  +o  %PROGSTART% - the recording's start time (from guide data;
     YYYYMMDDhhmmss)

  +o  %PROGEND% - the recording's end time (from guide data)

  +o  %PROGSTARTISO%, %PROGENDISO% - the recording's start and end time
     in ISO 8601 format.


  [1m12.5.  Advanced Recording Options[0m

  [1m12.5.1.  Creating Power Search rules with Custom Record[0m

  MythTV's "Custom Record" feature gives you unlimited control for
  creating specialized search recording rules to meet your needs. It
  allows you to choose your criteria to search for matching shows based
  on any of the information in the program listings, channel
  information, time functions and more. This goes beyond the
  capabilities of any other DVR system and it is unlikely that this
  level of scheduling customization will ever be available in any
  commercial DVR system.


  [1m12.5.2.  Getting Started[0m

  Go to Schedule Recordings->Custom Record. This page, helps you build a
  database search one clause at a time. Each added clause further limits
  which showings will be matched in the TV listings. You can test the
  search at any time and when you are done, you can save your search as
  a recording rule.

  To familiarize yourself with how you can create custom rules, create a
  simple rule to record "Nova" only in primetime.

  The first item at the top of the page allows you to edit an existing
  rule or create a new rule. Leave it on "<New rule>". Arrow down to the
  third item which says "Match an exact title". Right and left arrows
  would allow you to select any of several prefabricated pieces or full
  examples but leave it on the default for now. Arrow down to "Add this
  example clause" and press SELECT (Enter or Space on a keyboard). The
  large text box should now show:
            program.title = 'Nova'



  As you have probably guessed, this says that we want to search for all
  programs with the title "Nova" regardless of the time, day, channel,
  etc.

  If you do not receive a PBS station that carries "Nova" or would like
  to use another title, edit the title by pressing the down arrow to
  highlight the text box and right arrow over the the word "Nova". If
  you are using a keyboard you can simply delete the four letters and
  type a different title between the quotes. With a remote control, you
  can do 'cell phone' style text entry with the number pad. The delete
  key is the "X" in the grouping for "1", zero is grouped with "9" and
  "0" acts as the "Caps Lock" key. You can press ENTER in the text box
  to popup a virtual keyboard.

  Note: the text box honors many familiar Emacs control keys. It is also
  possible to cut and paste text into the text box so you can edit with
  a favorite editor or insert a rule sent in email or from other
  sources.

  In any case, choose a title that is shown both in primetime and late
  night or daytime. Next, click the "Test" button. You should see a list
  of the upcoming episodes for "Nova" just as if you had clicked the
  Upcoming button for "Nova" elsewhere in MythTV.

  Press ESC to go back to the Custom Record page. Move to the example
  selector then press the right or left arrows until you find "Only in
  primetime". Click "Add this example clause". You should now see:


                   program.title = 'Nova'
                   AND HOUR(program.starttime) >= 19
                   AND HOUR(program.starttime) < 23



  Click "Test". You should now see a shorter list with only the showings
  that begin between 7PM and 11PM. To create a rule for this, press ESC
  to go back to the custom page and move to "Rule Name:" then type
  "Nova" or anything else you would like. This is only a label and will
  not affect the search results. Once a name has been entered, the
  "Record" button will light up.  Click this to enter the recording
  options page. If you named it "Nova" the title will say "Nova (Power
  Search)". Set whatever options you would like then click "Save these
  settings". You now have a special rule to record "Nova" but only when
  it is shown in primetime.

  You can make further modifications to this rule by returning to the
  Custom Record page then press the right or left arrow keys on "Edit
  Rule:" until you find "Nova". You can experiment and test but the
  saved rule will not be updated until you click "Record" then "Save
  these settings".

  To remove this, or any other rule, you can go to the "Recording
  Priorities" page, arrow down to the title, press Enter and change the
  the recording type to "Do not record this program" then "Save these
  settings".



  [1m12.5.3.  How it Works[0m

  MythTV stores TV program information in a database and uses the
  Structured Query Language (SQL) to access the data. Information about
  each TV program is stored in the 'program' table and information about
  each TV station you receive is stored in 'channel'. These two tables
  are used in the scheduler queries and their columns are available to
  be used in your rules. The rules you create are stored in 'record'.

  Normal rules in MythTV simply match the title in the rule with the
  titles in the 'program' table. MythTV also has search rules for
  "Titles", "Keywords" and "People". These store the key phrase in the
  description column of the rule and includes them in specialized SQL
  replacements for the normal title check. There is also a type called
  "Power Search" which takes the raw SQL in the description as the
  replacement for title matching.

  Custom Record is a tool to help you build valid SQL for Power Search
  rules.  You do not need to be a SQL expert to use Custom Record
  because the examples are known to work correctly and are usually self-
  explanatory so you can choose the pieces you need then modify them.
  Many powerful solutions to unique problems are possible by combining
  the examples. With some creativity and some knowledge of SQL, the
  possibilities are limitless.


  [1m12.5.4.  Common Tricks and Tips[0m

  The example clauses marked "complete example" are actual rules that
  have been used to address specific problems. You may find that some of
  these are useful for you as-is or with slight modifications. These
  show off how powerful custom rules can be but there are also several
  simple idioms that you may find useful for many of the shows you would
  like to record.

  Wait for a known title -- If there is a movie that you anticipate will
  be televised in the coming months but is not yet in the listings, you
  can select "Match an exact title", edit the movie title, click
  "Record" then choose "Record one showing of this title". The rule will
  wait weeks, months or years until this title shows up in your listings
  then it will record one showing. These rules have no impact on the
  scheduler throughout the day and only take a tiny fraction of a second
  when the master backend starts or when the listings are updated.

  Silence series out of season -- "Celebrity Poker Showdown", for
  example, will have new episodes for a while then long periods where
  reruns are shown dozens of times per week. By checking the previously
  shown flag you can create a rule that will only match new episodes.
  Therefore, your schedule won't be polluted with dozens of entries
  marked as "Repeat" or "Previously Recorded".


              program.title = "Celebrity Poker Showdown"
              AND program.previouslyshown = 0



  This allows you to keep rules for your favorite shows that are dormant
  while out of season but will spring back to life when new episodes
  appear.

  Choose showings on certain days -- Several cable stations will show
  their highest rated shows a dozen on more times per week. However, the
  scheduler only needs two or three choices to do a good job of making a
  flexible choice.
              program.title LIKE "Celebrity Fit Club%"
              AND DAYNAME(program.starttime) = "Sunday"



  This says to choose any showing of an episode that hasn't been
  recorded when it appears on Sunday. This prevents all the other show-
  ings during the week from being listed in the schedule.

  Notice the word "LIKE" and the "%" at the end. This does wildcard
  matching so that this would match even if the title ended with "2".
  "III" or ":Revenge of the Snapple Lady". This can be useful where the
  title may change from one season to the next like "Survivor: %", "Big
  Brother%" or "The Amazing Race%".


  [1m12.5.5.  Working with SQL[0m

  As you experiment, it is possible that you may misplace a quote or
  mistype a word. If there is a mistake when you press "Test" or
  "Record" you will see an error message returned from the database.
  This will usually give you a good idea about what needs to be fixed.
  However, for more subtle MySQL syntax errors, you can find more
  information in the documentation at http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/
  <http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/>. This contains a lot of
  information that can be useful for Power Search rules such as the
  "Date and Time Functions". There are many other good resources for SQL
  on the Web.

  While the example clauses demonstrate how to use many of the data
  columns, you can get a more complete list of all the columns that are
  available by using a MySQL client program:


       $ mysql -u mythtv -pmythtv mythconverg
       mysql> describe program;
       mysql> describe channel;



  This will show the names of all of the columns along with their type
  and default value. Most are easy to understand but a few need some
  explanation in order to use them effectively with Power Search.

  +o  "program.category_type" holds one of these exact four strings:
     "movie", "series", "sports" or "tvshow".

  +o  "program.airdate" is a string representing the year of release for
     movies and may have no meaning for other types of shows.

  +o  "program.stars" is a floating point number from 0.0 to 1.0. On a
     four star scale, 1.0 would be four stars, 0.75 would be three stars
     and so on.

  +o  "program.originalairdate" if provided is the date when a show was,
     or will be, first televised. This may be useful for finding
     episodes before or after a certain date such as finding just the
     original series of "Battlestar Galactica".

  +o  "program.previouslyshown" is a column created by MythTV to try to
     determine if a showing is more than 14 days after its original air
     date or if the show was marked as a repeat and did not have a date
     for the first airing. If this is "0" it usually means that this is
     a brand new show or a rebroadcast within the first two weeks.
  +o  "program.generic" is a column created by MythTV to try mark
     showings for a series where the specific episode information is not
     included. When these generic showings appear, it is impossible for
     the system to determine if they are repeats of the same episode(s)
     or if they are all different episodes.

  +o  "program.first" is a column created by MythTV to mark the first
     showing in the current listings for each episode, movie or special.
     Choosing to match only the "first" showing can be useful for sports
     that are brodcast live then repeated.

  +o  "program.last" is a column created by MythTV to mark the last
     showing in the current listings for each episode, movie or special.
     If a showing is marked both "first" and "last" then it is the only
     showing of that program in the current TV listings.

  +o  "program.programid" is the Tribune Media Service database record
     identifier for each program description. In general, these start
     with a two letter prefix, MV, EP, SP or SH that correspond to the
     "program.category_type".  For most, the last four digits are "0000"
     except EP where the last four digits are the episode number in the
     series. Note that these are generated by TMS and not the show's
     producers but they are usually in the same order as the original
     air dates for the episodes.

  +o  "program.videoprop" also "audioprop" and "subtitletypes".  These
     columns contain bit flags for a variety of attributes that may be
     associated with a program. These are filled with information
     offered by the TV listings provider. However, your listings source
     will not have information for all of the available flags.
     Therefore, some of these may not be useful for your search rules.
     This information is organized in "sets" and the MySQL function
     FIND_IN_SET() can be used to test for any of these flags. For
     example:


       FIND_IN_SET('SURROUND', program.audioprop) > 0



  would be true for the programs where the surround sound bit is
  present.  To see all of the available attribute names:


       $ mysql -u mythtv -pmythtv mythconverg
       mysql> SHOW COLUMNS FROM program LIKE '%prop'\G
       mysql> SHOW COLUMNS FROM program LIKE 'subtitletypes'\G



  Finally, if you are doing something very experimental and a column is
  not giving you the results you had anticipated, you can always check
  the MythTV source code to see exactly how a column is used. The open
  source for MythTV is available from http://www.mythtv.org/
  <http://www.mythtv.org/> .


  [1m12.6.  Scheduling with more than one Input[0m


  MythTV is designed to allow recording television programs from one or
  more service providers, or video source, on one or more video input
  from each provider. Some inputs may not be allowed to record at the
  same time as each other while others may record simultaneously.
  A television station may be broadcast on more than one channel from
  one provider or may be available on channels from two or more
  providers. If a TV station is available from more than one source, the
  video quality or type of broadcast may differ. Therefore, MythTV
  allows you to control how you would like the scheduler to select the
  best channel and input for a show which is available on more than one
  input or more than one channel.


  [1m12.6.1.  Mutually Exclusive Inputs[0m

  A single TV capture card may have video connections to more than one
  of its inputs and each input may be from a different service.  The
  card may only be allowed to record from one of these inputs at one
  time because there is only one encoder on the card that actually
  captures the content.



  These are mutually exclusive meaning that only one input or the other
  may record at a given time but not both.

  Usually, inputs on different cards can record at the same time but two
  or more inputs on the same card cannot. However, there are cases where
  inputs on different cards should not be allowed to record at the same
  time, for example, a firewire card and s-video analog card connected
  to the same set top cable box.



       |
       |   coax +--------------+ firewire    ------------------+
       |     .-=|Cable Provider|=------------=| Card 1 input 1 | HDTV
       |     |  |HD/Cable STB  |=--.          +-----||||||||||||
       |     |  +--------------+   | s-video ------------------+
       |     |                     `---------=|        input 2 | Digital
       |wall |               coax             | Card 2         |
       |=---=^=------------------------------=|        input 3 | Cable
       |                                      +-----||||||||||||



  Input 1 and input 2 receive content from the same set top box and the
  channels can not be tuned independently. Therefore only one of these
  two inputs should be used at any given time. The solution is to create
  an "Input Group" with [1mmythtv-setup [22min "Input connections". Including
  these two inputs in the same Input Group will tell the scheduler that
  these are mutually exclusive and may not record at the same time.
  Inputs 2 and 3 are automatically mutually exclusive because they are
  on the same card so there is no need to create an Input Group for
  these inputs.

  Cards such as the Hauppauge PVR-500 are able to record as two cards
  simultaneously because it has two MPEG-2 encoders and each encoder
  appears as a separate device. DVB cards may be allowed to capture
  content from more than one channel at a time if the channels are in
  the same MUX.



  [1m12.6.2.  Stations, Channels and Video Sources[0m

  Although we may be accustomed to thinking of a broadcast station and
  its channel number as being synonymous, stations and channels are very
  different things. A "station" is in a building with wires and
  employees. A "channel" is a carrier frequency or digital ID that
  carries a broadcast stream. The same TV station may be broadcast over
  different frequencies in different cities or by different providers in
  the same city. The same frequency will carry different stations in
  different cities.  In the digital realm of DVB and ATSC (HDTV), it is
  even possible for a single frequency to carry multiple program streams
  but each of these streams of content are actually different channels
  that the receiving devices can 'tune' to independently.


  +o  Station: building

  +o  Channel: frequency

  In MythTV, a "video source" is a set of channels from a provider, or
  over the air, that can be received by an input. The set defines the
  channels and the broadcasters primarily associated with each of those
  channels.  If you have more than one device or cable from the same
  provider connected to more than one card and input, you only need to
  create one video source in mythtv-setup then associate that one source
  with each of these connected inputs. This will let your MythTV system
  know that the same channels and their TV listings are available to be
  recorded from any of these inputs.

  For example. A MythTV system may have two capture cards. Both have a
  cable connected to the coaxial connectors. These cables carry the
  local cable TV service. In mythtv-setup, the user should create one
  "Video source" called "Cable", for example. Under "Input connections",
  "Cable" should be associated with each of the two tuner inputs. The
  scheduler will then know that any program on one of the channels from
  the "Cable" source could be recorded by either card from the card's
  tuner input.

  You need to create a different video source for each provider or
  service that has a different set of channels. Each input with a
  connection to that service should be associated with the video source
  for that service so the system will know which set of channels are
  available for each of your active inputs.

  Let's say that this user also has one digital cable set top box. The
  digital cable service carries channels that are not available over
  basic cable. The user would create another source called "Digital".
  This set top box is connected to the second card by S-Video so under
  "Input connections", "Digital" is associated with the S-Video input of
  card 2. The system would then know that programs on channels from the
  Digital source can only be recorded from this input. Further, the
  scheduler understands that it can only record one show at a time from
  card 2 so it can assign Cable or Digital shows to the card but not
  both at the same time.

  Some TV stations may be broadcast over a channel from the Cable source
  and also broadcast over a channel from the Digital source. Note that
  two channels carrying the same primary station may not have the same
  TV listings due to carrying the primary station part time, including
  local programming exclusive to one of the channels, the channels may
  be in different timezones, etc. Listings information must be
  associated with each channel even if two or more channels report that
  they carry the same station.



  [1m12.6.3.  Order of Inputs[0m

  By default the scheduler chooses the first (lowest numbered) input
  which has a showing of the scheduled program as it fills the schedule.
  If a lower priority show is on at the same time as a higher priority
  show that has been assigned to input 1, then input 2 will be used next
  and so on. Therefore, configure your best card and input first and
  next best card and input second.  There may be differences in the type
  or brand of capture card, signal quality from the cable, system
  resources such as disk space, CPU, etc. By configuring your best input
  first, more recordings, and your highest priority recordings, will use
  that input.

  A common situation is that a newer and better card is added last. For
  example, you may initially setup your system with two analog cable
  cards and then add a HDTV card. If NBC is on a cable channel and "The
  Apprentice" is shown in HDTV on an NBC HD channel, the scheduler would
  still prefer analog inputs 1 and 2 over the new HD input 3.

  So, if you'd like the scheduler to prefer a new source, the simplest
  thing is to run [1mmythtv-setup [22mand "Delete all capture cards" then enter
  your cards and inputs in your preferred order. This will not remove
  your sources and channels - you want to keep those and only renumber
  your cards and inputs. In this example, once the changes have been
  made and the Master Backend is restarted, the scheduler would then
  choose "The Apprentice" in HD on the new input 1 and only use the
  analog inputs (now numbered 2 and 3) when the HDTV input was occupied
  with another show.


  [1m12.6.4.  Matching Callsigns[0m

  If a recording rule is a type that can record from any channel, "The
  Apprentice" would match for any channel that shows episodes which may
  include CNBC or BRAVO. However, for Single, Timeslot, Weekslot or
  Channel rules, "The Apprentice" would only match showings on the
  selected station as identified by the "callsign". For example, KVBC is
  an NBC affiliate on channel 3. Channel 733 is KVBCDT which is HDTV
  over cable from the same station. If a Single record rule was set for
  "The Apprentice" on KVBC channel 3, it could not record this showing
  from KVBCDT on 733. If 733 was chosen when the rule was saved, channel
  3 could not be used to record.

  However, the "Channel Editor" in mythtv-setup can be used to change
  the Callsign for channel 733 to "KVBC". MythTV would then understand
  that both of these channels are from the same broadcast station.
  Assuming the HDTV input was input number "1", "The Apprentice" would
  record on 733. If, however, this HDTV input already had a higher
  priority show assigned to it in that time slot, "The Apprentice" would
  be assigned to KVBC channel 3 on input 2.

  Having two channels with the same callsign may affect how program
  information is shown in mythfrontend. If two sources have the same
  callsign and channel number, the program guide and program lists will
  only show one instance of the channel number and callsign. If the same
  callsign is on two different channel numbers, both will be shown and
  if two sources have different callsigns with the same channel number,
  both of those will be shown.

  Continuing with the example above, the Electronic Program Guide would
  include rows for both "3 KVBC" and "733 KVBC". If channel 3 KVBC was
  also included in the Digital cable source, the EPG would still include
  just one line for "3 KVBC" even though there are two different
  channels, Cable and Digital, with this identification. Regardless of
  how these are displayed and which "KVBC" channel you select to add a
  rule to record "The Apprentice", the scheduler will pick the best
  channel, source and input to record "The Apprentice" on "KVBC".


  [1m12.6.5.  Using Priorities to Prefer an Input[0m

  The fundamental concept to keep in mind is that the MythTV scheduler
  will choose the lowest numbered input available when showings have the
  same priority. If there are factors that cause two showings of the
  same show to have different priorities then the higher priority
  showing will be considered before the showings with lower priority.


  [1m12.6.6.  Input Priority[0m

  "Input Connections" in mythtv-setup includes a box to set "Input
  priority" which defaults to "0". If a value is set, that amount will
  be added to the "total priority" for showings on that input. This can
  be used to influence using favored cards or not using less favored
  cards unless necessary.

  Let's say the "The Apprentice" is on at 8:00pm with a priority of 3.
  "Who Cares" is -2 and an episode is shown at 8:00pm then repeated at
  11:00pm. The scheduler would assign "The Apprentice" to card 1 and
  "Who Cares" to card 2 at 8:00pm. If the input priority for the input
  on card 2 was changed to -1, "Who Cares" would have a total priority
  of -2 for showings on card 1 and -3 for showings on card 2. The
  scheduler would assign "The Apprentice" to card 1 at 8:00pm and "Who
  Cares" to card 1 at 11:00pm when the better card is available. If
  there was another higher priority show at 11pm, the next best choice
  for "Who Cares" would be card 2 at 8pm with the priority -3.

  Card 1 and 2 have input priority "0":



        Time  Title     Priority  Card  Status
        8:00  The Apprentice  +3  1     Will Record
        8:00  Who Cares       -2  2     Will Record
       11:00  Who Cares       -2  1     Earlier Showing



  Card 2 with input priority "-1":



        Time  Title     Priority  Card  Status
        8:00  The Apprentice  +3  1     Will Record
        8:00  Who Cares       -3  2     Later Showing
       11:00  Who Cares       -2  1     Will Record



  Card 2 at "-1" but higher priority shows at both 8 P.M. and 11 P.M.:



        Time  Title     Priority  Card  Status
        8:00  The Apprentice  +3  1     Will Record
        8:00  Who Cares       -3  2     Will Record
       11:00  The Daily Show  +1  1     Will Record
       11:00  Who Cares       -3  2     Earlier Showing



  Note the two different effects, each of which may be what you desire
  depending on circumstance. If input priorities are equal, shows will
  record at the earliest time if any input is available. If input
  priorities differ, shows may be postponed to a later time in order to
  record on the best input.


  [1m12.6.7.  Channel Priority[0m

  Priority can be added for individual channels (remember, frequencies
  from a video source, not stations). This can be used to tell the
  system that you generally prefer the content of the station on a
  channel over the formats of other stations. You may want to raise the
  priority for ESPN, SciFi, Comedy Central or lower the priority for
  CSPAN, CourtTV, etc. If the same station is on two different channels,
  you can use channel priority to have the same effect for these
  channels as input priority would have for whole inputs.

  For example, say CNN is on analog channel 20 and there is an HD CNN on
  750.  You may not want to tie up the HD input for news originating in
  standard definition. Under TV Settings->Recording Priorities->Channel
  Priorities you could set channel 750 to -1. The scheduler would then
  prefer to record CNN shows on any analog channel 20 before considering
  using 750 only when there are no analog inputs available.


  [1m12.6.8.  Preferred Input[0m

  For an even finer grain of control, there is a per rule option to
  specify which input should be preferred for showings that match the
  rule. By default, this adds +2 to the priority for showings on the
  specified input.

  For illustration, let's say there will be a Space Shuttle launch on
  CNN that will be broadcast in high definition. Adding a rule to record
  the launch with priority "0" should default to channel 20 on input 2.
  Channel 750 would have this at -1 due to the channel priority set in
  the previous example. If on the recording options page for this rule,
  the "Scheduling Options" had the input set to prefer the HD input on
  card 1, then the showing on channel 750 for this input would be
  increased in value by +2 for a total of +1 and would be the best
  choice for this launch coverage.  While this one rule would prefer the
  HD input with channel 750, all other rules that match shows on CNN
  would still prefer channel 20.

  Note that this will not work properly if the preferred input priority
  does not out weigh differences in input and channel priorities.  The
  value of the priority boost when this option is chosen defaults to +2
  but can be modified in TV Settings->Recording Priorities->Set
  Recording Priorities.


  [1m12.6.9.  HDTV Priority[0m

  In the preceeding fictious example, the Space Shuttle launch is
  broadcast in high definition and a preferred input is selected to give
  preference to the HD input. However, TV listings from zap2it.com
  through the DataDirect service may allow this to work without having
  to use this per rule option.

  In Settings->Recording Priorities->Set Recording Priorities there is
  an option for "HDTV Recording Priority". This value will be added
  automatically if the listings for the show have the "hdtv" flag set.
  DataDirect will set this flag for shows known to be broadcast in HDTV
  on HD channels. However, the flag is not set for standard definition
  channels. This is another example of the listings being different for
  the same station on a different channel. If the HDTV priority is set
  to "+2", the shuttle launch would automatically have a total priority
  of +1 so that channel 750 would be preferred over channel 20 for this
  HDTV broadcast.

  Channel "750 CNN" at priority "-1" and HDTV broadcast priority at
  "+2":



  [1m12.6.10.  Custom Priority[0m



                           New for MythTV 0.21

  While Input, Channel, and HDTV Priority can be used for indicating a
  preference for certain programs and inputs, there may be circumstances
  that cannot be resolved easily with these standard features. MythTV
  version 0.21 includes a feature for "power priority". The Custom
  Priority editor in mythfrontend's "TV Settings" screen is similar to
  Custom Record, however, Custom Priority allows you to create
  specialized power priority factors to influence scheduling decisions.

  For example, the 'program.closecaptioned' flag can be used in a
  similar way as the 'program.hdtv' flag.



       Priority Rule Name: Closed Captioned priority
       Priority Value: 2
       program.closecaptioned > 0



  This will raise the priority of shows marked with "CC" over those that
  are not by applying the "Priority Value" whenever the SQL fragment
  evaluates to true. If the expression evaluates to false for a showing,
  the "Priority Value" is not applied.



       Priority Rule Name: Priority when shown once
       Priority Value: 1
       program.first > 0 AND program.last > 0



  The "first" and "last" flags for an episode will only be set for the
  same showing when there is only one showing of that episode in the
  current TV listings. This rule would raise the priority in these cases
  so that these shows would have an advantage to record in their only
  available time slot.



       Priority Rule Name: Input 1 signal quality
       Priority Value: -1
       cardinput.cardinputid = 1 AND
       channel.channum IN (3, 5, 39, 66)



  A common issue with two or more analog capture cards is that one of
  the cards may have more interference on some channels than the same
  channels on other cards. This example gives a disadvantage to the
  channels in this list but only for the first input. Therefore, a show
  on channel 39 would choose input 2 or 3 if possible but for channels
  not in this list, input 1 is still the first choice.

  The Custom Priority editor includes many example fragments and
  complete examples that can be used or you can create your own to suit
  your needs.

  The sections detailing configuration of the plugins assume that you
  are already in the ~/mythplugins-0.21/ directory.

  Note that a single [1mconfigure [22mscript now does configuration for all
  modules.  By default, it will compile all modules.  If you do not wish
  to compile a module, either because it is of no use to you, or you do
  not have the prerequisites, the simplest course of action is to go
  through the various sections below, satisfying the prerequisites, and
  then compile all modules at once.

  For example, you would only like to compile and install MythGallery
  and MythMusic.  For MythGallery, you would like to use the EXIF data
  in the .JPG file to present additional information onscreen.  For
  MythMusic, you would like to enable support for the opengl and FFT
  visualizations.  The command line would look like:

       $ cd ~/mythplugins-0.21
       $ ./configure --disable-all --enable-opengl --enable-mythgallery --enable-exif --enable-mythmusic --enable-fft
       $ qmake mythplugins.pro
       $ make
       $ su -
       # make install
       # exit
       $



  For simplicity, the examples below will disable compilation of all
  other modules other than the one being discussed.


  [1m14.  MythWeb.[0m

  MythWeb allows you to use a web page to control various aspects of
  your MythTV system.  MythWeb is a separate application, but it's
  dependent on MythTV being installed and operational.


  [1m14.1.  Installation and prerequisites[0m

  Mythweb is a part of the [1mmythplugins [22mpackage.  See ``MythPlugins'' for
  instructions on downloading the tarball. The next step depends on
  whether your distribution has a web server and if you have PHP
  support.


  [1m14.1.1.  Mandriva[0m

  Mandriva has [1mapache [22mand [1mPHP [22mpre-packaged, so installation is quite
  simple.



             [1mNOTE[22m: Mandriva 9.1 users, perform the following:


       # urpmi apache2 apache2-mod_php php-mysql
       # chkconfig --level 345 httpd on
       # /etc/rc.d/init.d/httpd restart



  [1m14.2.  Completing the installation[0m



       $ cd ~/mythplugins-0.21/mythweb
       $ su
       # mkdir /var/www/html/mythweb
       # cp -r . /var/www/html/mythweb
       # exit
       $



  By default, MythWeb uses an Apache .htaccess file to restrict access
  to the website and to configure some variables.

  To create the password file for Apache (if your system doesn't already
  have one), you could do something like this:


       # cd /var/www
       # htpasswd -c htpasswd mythtv
       New password:
       Re-type new password:
       Adding password for user mythtv



  See the man page for [1mhtpasswd [22mfor more examples.

  To access the web page, open a web browser and use [1mhttp://[name or ip[0m
  [1maddress]/mythweb/[0m



        [1mNOTE[22m: Make sure that you have a trailing slash on the URL,
  otherwise you will get a 404 Page not Found error.

  [1m14.3.  Resetting the key binding table[0m

  MythWeb allows you to configure which keys are bound to which actions
  within MythTV.  If you'd like to reset this back to the default,
  execute the following command:


       $ echo "delete from keybindings ;" | mysql -u mythtv -pmythtv mythconverg



  [1m14.4.  Resetting the theme.[0m

  If you find yourself wedged into a theme that isn't working, open your
  web browser and go to site:
  http://mythweb_name_or_ip_address/mythweb/settings.php?RESET_THEME=yes

  [1m15.  MythGallery.[0m

  MythGallery is a photo and slideshow application.  MythGallery is a
  separate application, but it's dependent on MythTV being installed and
  operational.

  [1m15.1.  Installation and prerequisites[0m

  MythGallery is a part of the [1mmythplugins [22mpackage.  See ``MythPlugins''
  for instructions on downloading the tarball.

  There are a number of transitions available, some requiring OpenGL
  support.  You will also need to install a TIFF library.  Under
  Mandriva, you would perform the following command:


       # urpmi libtiff3-devel


  Once you have satisfied the prerequisites for your distribution,
  install the application:


       $ cd ~/mythplugins-0.21
       $ ./configure --disable-all --enable-opengl --enable-mythgallery
       $ qmake mythplugins.pro
       $ make
       # su
       # make install
       # exit
       $



  The configuration for MythGallery is accessed through the main Setup
  option in mythfrontend.  Make sure you set your pictures directory to
  wherever you're storing your photos.

  The controls for MythGallery can be found in the README that comes
  with the application.

  [1m15.2.  Using MythGallery[0m

  When you first start MythGallery, you will see a thumbnail view of any
  folders and pictures in the Gallery Directory you specified in setup.
  If this is the first time you have accessed this directory, the
  thumbnails will be generated on the fly.  If the Gallery Dir is
  writable, these thumbnails will be cached thus speeding up future
  access.  On the left is a greyed-out menu of options.

  Use the arrow keys to select a folder or picture to open/view with the
  Select key, or use the Menu key to toggle access the menu on the left.
  The menu options are as follows:

  +o  Slideshow - Will cycle through all the pictures in the current
     folder.  The currently selected item must be a picture (not a
     folder) for this to work.  It does not currently traverse
     subfolders.

  +o  Rotate CW - Rotate the current image 90 degrees in the clockwise
     direction.  This change persists if the current directory is
     writable.

  +o  Rotate CCW - As above except the direction of rotation is
     counter(anti) clockwise.

  +o  Import - Import pictures into your Gallery Dir.  This option is
     described in the next section.

  +o  Settings - Access the MythGallery settings screen.

  [1m15.3.  Importing Pictures[0m

  The import path in the setup dialog is a colon separated list of
  directories and/or executable files.  When the import key is pressed,
  a new directory (the destination directory) under the current
  directory will be created and the import path will be searched.  If
  the item in the import path is a directory (the source directory), the
  contents of that directory will be copied to the destination
  directory. If you would like the source directory to be that of a
  removable device, it might be a good idea to use autofs.  See the
  automount howto at www.linuxdoc.org <www.linuxdoc.org> for info on how
  to get it working.

  If the item in the import path is an executable file, MythGallery will
  attempt to execute it with the destination directory as its sole
  argument.  Be careful when using executable scripts that the script
  runs unattended (doesn't need user intervention) and returns properly,
  otherwise it could create the appearance of MythGallery hanging (e.g.
  running [1msmbclient [22mand prompting for password).  Also be sure that
  scripts have executable permissions set.

  Here is an example script that a user may want to run on import:


       #!/bin/csh

       if ($#argv == 0) then
               echo "Usage: $0 dest_dir"
               exit
       endif

       cd $argv[1]

       # get stuff over the network
       wget http://www.somesite.dom/dir/file1.jpg
       wget http://www.somesite.dom/dir/file2.jpg
       wget http://www.somesite.dom/dir/file3.jpg

       # stuff that requires manual module loading and/or fs mounting
       modprobe camera_module
       mount /dev/camera /mnt/camera
       cp /mnt/camera/* $argv[1]
       umount /mnt/camera
       rmmod camera_module

       # perform some processing
       foreach pname (`ls *.jpg`)
               jpegtran -flip vertical $pname > $pname.new
               mv $pname.new $pname
       end



  [1m16.  MythGame.[0m

  MythGame can used as a frontend to start any emulator that your host
  OS runs. This is an example of how to set up xmame on Linux.
  http://www.mameworld.net/ <http://www.mameworld.net/> is an excellent
  resource for all things mame.

  Installation overview:

  1. Setup directory structure

  2. Download and install xmame

  3. Download and place extra files (artwork/catver.ini/etc..)

  4. Download and install MythGame plugin

  5. Setup xmame in MythGame

  6. Hints



  [1m16.1.  Setup Directory Structure[0m

  To keep things organized, create the following directories for [1mxmame[0m
  to use in /usr/local/share/xmame: hiscore, roms, and snaps.



       $ mkdir -p /usr/local/share/xmame/{highscore,roms,snaps}



  [1m16.2.  Download and Install xmame[0m

  [1mNOTE[22m:  There may be pre-packaged versions of [1mxmame [22mavailable for your
  distribution.  Check http://x.mame.net/download.html
  <http://x.mame.net/download.html> for the latest version.

  Download the source to [1mxmame [22mfrom
  http://x.mame.net/download/xmame-0.103.tar.bz2
  <http://x.mame.net/download/xmame-0.103.tar.bz2>



       $ wget http://x.mame.net/download/xmame-0.103.tar.bz2
       $ tar -xjf xmame-0.103.tar.bz2
       $ cd xmame-0.103



  Edit the Makefile with your favorite editor.  Adjust the options as
  required for your system.


       $ joe Makefile



  Then make and install xmame


       $ make
       $ su
       (enter password)
       # make install
       # exit



  After [1mmame [22mhas been installed, we need to create some defaults.


       $ mkdir ~/.xmame
       $ cp docs/xmamerc.dist ~/.xmame/xmamerc



  Because some ROMS work better with different display toolkits, or
  possibly even older versions of xmame, it's convenient to keep all of
  your [1mxmame [22mbinaries and to rename them to include the version number.
  MythGame allows you to match individual roms to preferred binaries.
       $ su
       (enter password)
       # mv /usr/local/bin/xmame.x11 /usr/local/bin/xmame-0.103.x11
       # exit



  [1mNOTE[22m: Depending on how you compiled [1mxmame[22m, you may have [1mxmame.X11[22m,
  [1mxmame.SDL [22mor [1mxmame.xgl [22mbased on what display toolkit you used. Also,
  you may need to remove and recreate xmamerc after upgrading since some
  of the default options may have changed.

  Edit ~/.xmame/xmamerc to include your paths.


       ### Fileio Related ###
       rompath                         /usr/local/share/xmame/roms

  Confirm that [1mxmame [22mworks before running it inside MythTV. Place your
  ROM in the /usr/local/share/xmame/roms directory you created earlier.

  [1mNOTE[22m: There are three public domain ROM sets available at
  http://www.mame.net/downmisc.html <http://www.mame.net/downmisc.html>

  Launch [1mxmame [22mwith your game of choice.  In this example, we are using

  [1m17.  MythMusic.[0m

  MythMusic has a number of prerequisites that must be satisfied before
  it is operational.  Depending on your distribution, some of these
  prerequisites can be satisfied through the various package managers.
  If your distribution doesn't offer pre-compiled versions of the
  software below, then follow the generic instructions for manually
  compiling and installing the software.

  The prerequisites for MythMusic are:

  +o  MAD

  +o  taglib

  +o  libogg and libvorbis

  +o  FLAC

  +o  libcdaudio

  +o  CDParanoia


  [1m17.1.  Manual installation of prerequisites[0m

  These instructions are for distributions which don't have pre-compiled
  versions of the software necessary to run MythTV.

  [1m17.2.  Mandriva[0m

  Mandriva has a number of the prerequisites available on the
  installation CD.  Some of the software you're going to need will have
  to be obtained from the "contrib" or "cooker" development
  repositories.  Applications downloaded from "cooker" come from the
  development branch, so there may be issues with some software.  It
  isn't recommended that you mix cooker and release-level software.


  [1murpmi [22mis the simplest tool for installation of packages from the
  command line.  The difficult part is the configuration, but this has
  been made easier at the following website:
  http://addmedia.linuxfornewbies.org/
  <http://addmedia.linuxfornewbies.org/> The website will allow you to
  choose a mirror site and then present the command-line configuration
  text for that mirror.  You will most likely need to add a "Contrib"
  mirror to your setup.  Once you have done that, you can proceed.  If
  [1murpmi [22mprompts you about other modules that need to be installed to
  satisfy dependencies, say "Yes".

       # urpmi libcdda0 libcdda0-devel libvorbis0 libvorbis0-devel
       # urpmi libcdaudio1-devel libid3tag0 libid3tag0-devel



  [1m17.2.1.  Additional options with MythMusic[0m

  Additional visualizations have been added to MythMusic.  If you wish
  to use these, there are some prerequisites you must install prior to
  compiling.


  +o  fftw

  +o  OpenGL

  +o  SDL

  fftw may be obtained from http://www.fftw.org/ <http://www.fftw.org/>.
  In Mandriva it may be installed by typing:

  # urpmi libfftw2 libfftw2-devel



  OpenGL should be installed on practically all distributions.  However,
  you will need the devel module.  In Mandriva it may be installed by
  typing:


       # urpmi libMesaGLU1-devel



  SDL may be obtained from http://www.libsdl.org
  <http://www.libsdl.org>.  In Mandriva it may be installed by typing:


       # urpmi libSDL1.2 libSDL1.2-devel



  [1m17.3.  Red Hat Linux 9[0m

  Red Hat provides packages for several of the prerequisites, making
  installation very simple. Of the prerequisites, Red Hat provides
  packages for Vorbis, cdparanoia, SDL, and OpenGL (which you probably
  already have installed). To install these all at once, simply type
  (all on the same line):


       $ up2date --solvedeps libvorbis libvorbis-devel vorbis-tools cdparanoia-devel cdparanoia-libs cdparanoia SDL-devel SDL



  If you get the following message: "None of the packages you requested
  were found, or they are already updated" it probably means you already
  have all of those packages installed.

  You must install the remaining packages, (MAD, FLAC, libcdaudio and
  optionally fftw) manually following the installation directions above.
  When installing fftw do not use the rpm package offered on the website
  because it will cause an error, so use the source package instead.



  [1mNOTE[22m: you can use the instructions given at the ``automated
        installation section'' to install all of MythMusic in one
  step.

  [1m17.4.  Compiling MythMusic[0m

  Once all the prerequisites have been installed, you can proceed with
  compiling MythMusic.



  $ cd ~/mythplugins-0.21
  $ ./configure --disable-all --enable-mythmusic --enable-fftw --enable-sdl --enable-aac
  $ qmake mythplugins.pro
  $ make
  $ su
  # make install
  # exit



  [1m17.5.  Configuring MythMusic[0m

  Configuration of MythMusic occurs in two places.  The main
  mythfrontend Setup is for global MythMusic configuration.  Go to the
  Setup/MythMusic/General Setup screen and adjust it for your particular
  configuration.

  The second configuration screen is within the MythMusic program and
  will allow you rescan your music library, etc.

  Here's some explanation about the Ignore_ID3 and The
  NonID3FileNameFormat:

  If Ignore_ID3 is set to TRUE, MythMusic will try to determine the
  Genre, Artist, Album, Track Number, and Title from the filename of the
  mp3 file.  The NonID3FileNameFormat variable should be set to the
  directory/file format where the mp3 files are stored.  For instance, I
  store mine in the above shown Genre/Artist/Album/Track format.
  MythMusic will then use this information to fill in the proper fields
  when it populates the musicmetadata table rather than searching for an
  ID3 tag in the mp3 file.

  The files can be laid out in any format, such as:

  Genre/Artist/Album/Title Artist/Genre/Album/Title Artist/Album/Title
  (with Genre left as Unknown)

  The track number is optional but can be specified with the title by
  using the TRACK_TITLE keyword instead of TITLE.  If TRACK_TITLE is
  used, then the filename can have a space, hyphen, or underscore
  separating the track number from the track title.  Keywords are case
  insensitive, so if you specify GENRE it's the same as Genre in the
  format field.

  The Ignore_ID3 option does not disable the code that determines the
  track length, just the portion that tries to read ID3 info.


  [1m17.6.  Using MythMusic[0m

  MythMusic is fairly simple to use.  It is recommended that you insert
  the CD before selecting "Import CD".  You should also ensure that your
  system doesn't try to automount the CD and begin playing it
  automatically.

  Here's some information on playlist management:

  Q: How do I create a new playlist?  A: Using the MythMusic "Select
  Music" menu option, setup the playlist as you normally would by adding
  songs or other playlists as needed.  When you are ready to save the
  new playlist, highlight "Active Play Queue" at the bottom of the
  selection tree and hit the "i" key. This will pop up a menu allowing
  you to name and save the new playlist.  You can also hit Enter to
  bring up the popup on the Active Play Queue. This does not work on the
  playlists above, as Enter is obviously bound to checking/unchecking
  the boxes. Any number (i.e. keypad on remote) will also bring up the
  menu in both cases.

  Q: How do I enter the playlist name in the text field without a
  keyboard?  A: Use the keypad number keys (bound to your remote) to
  select letters quasi-cell phone style. Keys 2-9 work pretty much like
  any cell phone text entry. 1 cycles through a few special characters,
  delete, and space. 0 is like a CAPS LOCK. Hard to describe, fairly
  easy to use. You will soon be able to specify the cycle timing in a
  Setup screen. You can type fairly quickly through a combination of
  jumping around the number keys AND hitting a non-number key (right
  arrow is particularly good for this) to force the current character.

  Q: How do I edit a playlist?  A: Highlight the playlist in the
  selection tree and hit the "i" key then select "Move to Active Play
  Queue" in the popup.  You can now modify the "Active Play Queue" like
  normal, adding songs and playlists by selecting them from the song
  tree.  When you are done, highlight the "Active Play Queue" in the
  selection tree and hit the "i" key then select "Save Back to Playlist
  Tree".  And whatever you were editing as your Active Queue before you
  moved an existing playlist "on top" of Active reappears. Think of
  Active has having a push on, pop off capability, but with a depth of
  only 1.

  Q: How do I delete an item from a playlist?  A: Highlight the item in
  the selection tree and hit the "d" key.

  Q: How do I rearrange the songs in my playlist?  A: Highlight a song
  and hit the "space" bar, the song will now have pair of red arrows in
  front of it.  Use the up and down arrow keys to move it around in the
  playlist.  When you have it where you want it, hit the "space" bar
  again.

  Q: How do I delete a playlist?  A: Highlight the playlist in the
  selection tree and hit the "i" key then select "Delete this Playlist"
  from the popup.


  [1m17.7.  Troubleshooting MythMusic[0m

  You may run into errors when running MythMusic.

  [1m17.7.1.  When I run MythMusic and try and look up a CD, I get an error[0m
  [1mmessage[0m

  The full text of the message will say:

  databasebox.o: Couldn't find your CD. It may not be in the freedb
  database.  More likely, however, is that you need to delete  /.cddb
  and  /.cdserverrc and restart mythmusic. Have a nice day.

  If you get this message, you should go to the home directory of
  whatever user MythMusic is running as and type:


       rm .cdserverrc
       rm -rf .cddb/



  These files aren't automatically deleted because of a conscious design
  decision by the author that programs that automatically delete things
  are bad.

  The files are used to locally cache CD lookups. If you are re-
  inserting CDs, your machine will not actually have to go out to the
  Internet to determine what is on them.  However, the URL used to
  access the freedb database has recently changed, so the stale
  information in the files from previous runs of MythMusic would cause
  the error above.  Once the files have been deleted the stale
  information will be gone and your local database will be rebuilt as
  you use CDs.


  [1m18.  MythWeather.[0m

  MythWeather is a part of the [1mmythplugins [22mpackage.  See ``MythPlugins''
  for instructions on downloading the tarball.



       $ cd ~/mythplugins-0.21
       $ ./configure --disable-all --enable-mythweather
       $ qmake mythplugins.pro
       $ make
       $ su
       # make install
       # exit



  MythWeather uses MSNBC.com as its source for weather data and
  weather.com for its radar image.

  These are the keyboard commands for MythWeather:


       Left Key             Goes back one page, and extends the time spent
                            on the page you are on.
       Right Key            Goes forward one page, see above.
       Space                Pause, wait on the current page until space is hit
                            again.
       Numeric Keys         You can check other weather by keying in other ZIP codes.
       Enter Key            Switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit. Can also
                            be used a way to force a data update.
       "m" Key              Resets the location to the database default, then updates the data.
       "i"                  Enter / Save settings
       ESC                  Exit the settings screen without saving / Exit the program



  MythWeather also has an "Aggressiveness" setting.  This affects how
  long MythWeather waits for data from the msnbc.com website before
  timing out.  If you are on a slow connection, or have a slow DNS, or
  MythWeather just doesn't seem to be working and you've already tried
  everything else, then try increasing the aggressiveness level
  parameter.  This parameter is inverse; a higher number actually means
  that MythWeather will be less aggressive, and will therefore wait
  longer before timing out.

  MythWeather will print debugging information on the terminal.  If you
  wish to see additional debugging information while MythWeather is
  running, run mythweather from the command line with as mythweather
  --debug

  You may also force mythweather to re-run the configuration by starting
  it on the command line as mythweather --configure.  These two options
  are mutually exclusive.
  [1m19.  MythVideo.[0m

  MythVideo is a part of the [1mmythplugins [22mpackage.  See ``MythPlugins''
  for instructions on downloading the tarball.

  MythVideo will allow you to use an external program to watch media
  files that are not directly supported by MythTV.



       $ cd ~/mythplugins-0.21
       $ ./configure --disable-all --enable-mythvideo
       $ qmake mythplugins.pro
       $ make
       $ su
       # make install
       # exit



  See MythVideo's README file for additional information.


  [1m20.  MythDVD.[0m

  MythDVD is a part of the [1mmythplugins [22mpackage.  See ``MythPlugins'' for
  instructions on downloading the tarball.  MythDVD is an application
  which rips DVDs and makes them available for use with MythVideo.  You
  may also transcode the DVD content from MPEG-2 to other formats which
  should greatly reduce the amount of space the DVD material takes up on
  your hard drive.

  MythDVD has a number of prerequisites to enable transcoding
  functionality.  If you only wish to play DVDs rather than convert them
  to something like MPEG-4 or xvid you may skip the prerequisite
  installation step.


  [1m20.1.  Manual Compilation of Prerequisites[0m


  [1m20.2.  Pre-compiled binaries[0m

  Mandriva users may install the prerequisites this way:


       # urpmi libdvdread3 libdvdread3-devel a52dec liba52dec-devel
       # urpmi mplayer ogle xine



  Assuming that you've added a PLF mirror, you may also load the rest of
  the prerequisites using the following command:


       # urpmi xvid xvid-devel fame libfame0.9-devel transcode libdvdcss



  In the example below, we have enabled support for transcoding and for
  VCD playing.  You may remove these options if you don't need them.


  $ cd ~/mythplugins-0.20
  $ ./configure --disable-all --enable-mythdvd --enable-transcode --enable-vcd
  $ qmake mythplugins.pro
  $ make
  $ su
  # make install



  [1m20.3.  Running the Myth Transcoding Daemon[0m

  Transcoding ("ripping") a DVD requires you to run the Myth Transcoding
  Daemon (mtd).  To ensure that mtd is configured correctly, you should
  first test it at the command line.


       $ mtd -n



  The last line of text should show something like:


       mtd is listening on port 2342



  This indicates that mtd is ready for use.  Once you've successfully
  tested mtd in the foreground, type [1mCTRL-C [22mto stop mtd.  You may then
  start it as a background (daemon) process.


       $ mtd -d



  Running mtd as a daemon will allow you to automatically start it
  during the boot process.  For example, you may add mtd -d to your
  rc.local file, or you can adjust the script/steps outlined in the
  section called ``Automatically starting mythbackend at system boot
  time'' to start mtd instead of mythbackend.


  [1m21.  MythNews.[0m

  MythNews is a part of the [1mmythplugins [22mpackage.  See ``MythPlugins''
  for instructions on downloading the tarball.  MythNews is a RSS
  reader.


       $ cd ~/mythplugins-0.21
       $ ./configure --disable-all --enable-mythnews
       $ qmake mythplugins.pro
       $ make
       $ su
       # make install



  [1m22.  Troubleshooting.[0m

  [1m22.1.  Compiling[0m

  [1m22.1.1.  Compile errors[0m

  Some compile errors are worse than others.  If you get an error that
  doesn't abort the compilation, and says something like:


       cc1plus: warning: changing search order for system directory
       "/usr/local/include"
       cc1plus: warning:   as it has already been specified as a non-system
       directory



  then it shouldn't be a problem.

  If you get an error like /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lXext, the compiler
  is telling you that you don't have XFree86-devel installed, or that
  your distribution hasn't set it up correctly.  This needs to be fixed
  before MythTV will compile.


  [1m22.1.2.  make: *** No rule to make target[0m
  [1m/usr/lib/qt3/mkspecs/default/qmake.conf', needed by Makefile'.  Stop.[0m

  This error happens when there's a missing link in the
  /usr/lib/qt3/mkspecs directory.  There are two ways to fix this error:

  1.  Create the link manually:


       $ su
       # cd /usr/lib/qt3/mkspecs
       # ln -sf linux-g++ default



  and then restart the compile,

  or

  2.  Run [1mqmake mythtv.pro [22min the mythtv directory.  Rerunning [1mqmake[0m
  will create a new Makefile for you, however this still doesn't fix the
  root cause of the issue, which is that your distribution didn't create
  the symlink for you when the qt3 package was installed.  The first
  choice is the better solution.


  [1m22.1.3.  make: *** No rule to make target[0m
  [1m/mkspecs/default/qmake.conf', needed by Makefile'.  Stop.[0m

  You didn't set your QTDIR.  Re-read the section on ``Setting up
  paths''.


  [1m22.1.4.  Internal Segmentation Fault.[0m

  This is most likely to be caused by an overheating processor rather
  than an actual programming fault within gcc.

  [1m22.2.1.  MythTV segfaults[0m

  [1m22.2.2.  MythTV isn't doing anything[0m

  [1m22.2.3.  Debugging with GDB[0m

  Without details, the developers will not be able to determine if you
  have discovered a genuine code-bug,  or if the problem is with your
  system.  In order to determine what's going on, you must recompile
  MythTV with debugging support and run MythTV within [1mgdb[22m, the GNU
  debugger.  Note that, on OS X, some data is provided without going
  through these steps.  See
  /Library/Logs/CrashReporter/MythFrontend.crash.log

  Re-run the [1mconfigure [22mscript and add --compile-type=debug to any
  previous configuration options you may have used.  Check the
  config.log file if you have forgotten.

  Now, you need to clear out the old versions of the software to ensure
  that you're running with the debugging code, then compile and install.


       $ make distclean
       $ ./configure --compile-type=debug
       $ make
       $ su
       # make install
       # exit



  At this point, you now have debug-enabled software ready.  To make
  sure that you don't forget to type a command required for debugging,
  it's best to setup a gdbcommands file.  This will be read by [1mgdb [22mwhen
  it's started.  Put the following into gdbcommands in your home
  directory:



       handle SIGPIPE nostop noprint
       handle SIG33 nostop noprint
       set logging on
       set pagination off
       set breakpoint pending on
       break qFatal
       set args -l myth.log -v record,channel,siparser
       run
       thread apply all bt full
       set logging off



  Let's assume that the problem you're having is in [1mmythbackend[22m.

  command line.

  If the program appears to be locked up, press CTRL-C to create the
  backtrace file.

  All of the output from gdb.txt should be posted to the mythtv-dev
  mailing list, along with the steps you followed to get the program to
  crash.

  [1mNOTE[22m:  If you're trimming the gdb.txt file to remove extraneous
  information from the beginning of the file, make sure you include at
  least 10 lines [4mprior[24m to the point where the backtrace actually begins.
  This ensures that there is some context to the backtrace, and so that
  it's possible to see what exactly caused the segfault.

  [1mgdb [22mhas a number of options, read the man page for more information.

  Using the gdbcommands file in conjunction with a [1mwhile [22mloop will
  ensure that [1mgdb [22mcreates a trace file and then restarts:



       $ while true; do date >> gdb.txt; gdb mythbackend -x gdbcommands; done;



  [1mNOTE[22m: To exit this loop you will need to kill the while loop.

  If you're trying to troubleshoot and you can't get back to the [1mgdb[0m
  window for some reason, it may be easier to use two systems or to
  start mythfrontend from the text console.

  If you're going to troubleshoot from a remote system, connect to the
  machine that you're going to test using [1mssh [22mor [1mtelnet[22m. Next, type $
  export DISPLAY=localhost:0.0.  This will allow the graphics to be
  displayed on the X console (usually ALT-F6 or ALT-F7) and still give
  you output and control of [1mmythfrontend[22m, either from the [1mssh [22msession,
  or by switching back to the text console by pressing CTRL-ALT-F1.  You
  can now continue troubleshooting using [1mgdb [22mas detailed in the

  all available CPU.  You will not be able to interrupt the process, so
  for all intents and purposes your computer will have crashed.


  [1m22.3.  Installing[0m

  [1m22.3.1.  When trying to run mythtv-setup, you get an error like this:[0m
  [1m"mythtv-setup: error while loading shared libraries:"[0m

  You didn't add /usr/local/lib to /etc/ld.so.conf.  See the section on
  modifying ``/etc/ld.so.conf''.


  [1m22.4.  Using[0m

  [1m22.4.1.  No programs are displayed in "Watch Recordings"[0m

  This situation occurs most often with a system that acts as a frontend
  and a slave backend. MythTV supports system-global and user-specific
  configuration files, with user-configuration files taking precedence.
  99% of the configuration for MythTV is in the MySQL database, but
  MythTV still needs to know where the MySQL server is running.  This
  information is in the mysql.txt file.  By default, it will be
  installed to /usr/local/share/mythtv, but a copy placed into ~/.mythtv
  will over-ride the global configuration.

  You must ensure that there aren't multiple, conflicting versions of
  this file on your system!


       $ locate mysql.txt
       /usr/local/share/mythtv/mysql.txt
       /home/mythtv/.mythtv/mysql.txt
       $



  As you can see, in this example there are two mysql.txt files.  If
  they are not identical, then there may be unintended consequences.

  You may also see this error if you completely fill the /var partition.
  The most likely [4mmythtv-related[24m reason for this is an overly large
  mythbackend or mythfrontend log file in /var/log. If you have logging
  enabled for the backend, and myth runs for weeks at a time, this may
  creep up and surprise you. Note that many system processes also write
  to /var and the system may not boot if it is unable to write to /var
  due to a full partition.


  [1m22.4.2.  MySQL not connecting correctly[0m

  Your [1mMySQL [22minstallation may have networking turned off.  Check that
  /etc/mysql/my.cnf [4mdoes[24m [4mnot[24m contain skip-networking.  If it does,

  [1mdown[0m

  This is a different problem than the one discussed in the previous
  section.  Currently, the ivtv driver or firmware appear to have some
  issues if the vertical capture resolution is not the full screen
  height.  If you are having a jitter problem then ensure that you are
  capturing either 480 lines (for NTSC) or 576 lines (for PAL).  The
  default capture profiles may need to be edited for your setup.  Go to
  Settings->TV Settings->Recording Profiles and adjust the [1mDefault [22mand
  [1mLive TV [22moptions to 480 or 576 from their defaults.


  [1m22.4.6.  Screen goes blank but returns when mouse is moved or keyboard[0m
  [1mis used[0m

  This is due to DPMS, the Display Power Management System, which is
  used to save power by turning off your monitor when the system decides
  that it's not being used or due to a screensaver that has defaulted to
  a blank screen.  MythTV now has DPMS support built-in, and should
  intelligently handle the screen.  Continue reading if you wish to
  override DPMS and force it off.

  Since it's likely that watching TV will not generate keyboard or mouse
  events for a time, you need to turn off DPMS and the screensaver.
  There are a few ways to do this.  You may also need to check your BIOS
  for power saving modes and disable screen blanking there as well.

  Edit your /etc/X11/XF86Config-4 or /etc/X11/xorg.conf file, and look
  for:


       Section "ServerFlags"
           #DontZap # disable <Ctrl><Alt><BS> (server abort)
           #DontZoom # disable <Ctrl><Alt><KP_+>/<KP_-> (resolution switching)
           AllowMouseOpenFail # allows the server to start up even if the mouse doesn't work

           Option "blank time" "0"
           Option "standby time" "0"
           Option "suspend time" "0"
           Option "off time" "0"
           Option "NoPM" "1"
       EndSection



  Also, look for:



  Section "Device"
      Identifier "device1"
      VendorName "nVidia Corporation"
      BoardName "NVIDIA GeForce 256 (generic)"
      Driver "nv"
      Option "DPMS"
  EndSection



  In this case, you would need to either delete the Option "DPMS" line,
  or change it to # Option "DPMS" to comment it out.  The next time you
  start XFree this change will take effect.

  Finally, check:


       Section "Monitor"
           Identifier "monitor1"
           VendorName "Plug'n Play"
           HorizSync 30-85
           VertRefresh 50-160

           # Sony Vaio C1(X,XS,VE,VN)?
           # 1024x480 @ 85.6 Hz, 48 kHz hsync
           ModeLine "1024x480"    65.00 1024 1032 1176 1344   480  488  494  563 -hsync -vsync

           # TV fullscreen mode or DVD fullscreen output.
           # 768x576 @ 79 Hz, 50 kHz hsync
           ModeLine "768x576"     50.00  768  832  846 1000   576  590  595  630

           # 768x576 @ 100 Hz, 61.6 kHz hsync
           ModeLine "768x576"     63.07  768  800  960 1024   576  578  590  616
       EndSection



  Ensure that there isn't an Option "DPMS" in the Monitor configuration.

  You can also turn off DPMS from the Command Line, but this will not
  survive a reboot.


       $ xset -dpms



  Using xset +dpms will turn it back on.

  Another technique to try, which will turn off the screensaver:


       $ xset s off



  You may also combine the command to turn off DPMS and the screensaver:


       $ xset -dpms s off


  Finally, depending on your distribution, you may be able to turn it
  off from within the control panel.

  [1m22.5.  Miscellaneous[0m

  [1m22.5.1.  mythfilldatabase failing[0m

  If mythfilldatabase suddenly appears to be failing, there are at least
  two things to check.

  First, if you are in North America, ensure that your DataDirect
  subscription is still valid, otherwise, check to see what version of
  XMLTV you're running and that it's the latest version.



         [1mNOTE[22m:  It is highly recommended that you run the latest
  version of XMLTV available.  Your listings provider may have made
  changes which negatively impact XMLTV.


  [1m22.5.2.  Fast CPU, choppy or jittery video[0m

  First, you should check that your kernel has been enabled for DMA:


       [mythtv@pvr mythtv]$ dmesg |grep DMA
           ide0: BM-DMA at 0xd800-0xd807, BIOS settings: hda:DMA, hdb:DMA
           ide1: BM-DMA at 0xd808-0xd80f, BIOS settings: hdc:DMA, hdd:pio
       hda: 156301488 sectors (80026 MB) w/2048KiB Cache, CHS=9729/255/63, UDMA(33)
       hdb: 80043264 sectors (40982 MB) w/2048KiB Cache, CHS=4982/255/63, UDMA(33)



  From the listing above, you can see that hda, hdb and hdc are set for
  DMA, and hdd is set for pio.  If your kernel is not reporting DMA
  being enabled, you may need to recompile your kernel. Check your
  motherboard's chipset (look in the "ATA/IDE/MFM/RLL support" section
  in "make menuconfig") for more information.

  Next, check that the hard drive has DMA enabled.  Use the [1mhdparm[0m
  program to check and enable DMA.


       # hdparm -d /dev/hd?



  will tell you the DMA status for your hard drives.  If you run [1mhdparm[0m
  with the -d1 parameter, it will turn DMA on.


  You may also setup your PC to do this at boot time, either by adding
  the command to your /etc/rc.local file, or by adding files to
  /etc/sysconfig.

  On Mandriva and other distributions, if you install [1mhdparm [22mfrom an RPM
  you will most likely get a /etc/sysconfig/harddisks file installed.
  This file will be parsed by the /etc/rc.sysinit script.  If you use
  the default harddisks file, your changes will affect all IDE devices
  (including CD ROMs).  If you wish to use different parameters for
  various devices, rename and/or copy the file to harddiskhda,
  harddiskhdb, etc.  Edit the file to your liking and on the next reboot
  your setting will be preserved.


  [1m22.5.3.  Frontend appears to be slow at jumping / seeking.[0m

  [1m22.5.4.  On-screen Display shows incorrect program length.[0m

  This may occur when MythTV doesn't have an accurate seek table.  Run
  [1mmythcommflag --rebuild[0m


  [1m22.5.5.  Troubleshooting audio[0m



      [1mNOTE[22m:  the following instructions do not apply to PVR-250/350
  encoders; the MPEG-2 file will have the audio embedded in the stream
  so it is not accessible using /dev/dsp.

  Audio appears to be one of the bigger issues that users run into on
  the mailing list.  If the audio isn't configured correctly, then
  MythTV will often appear to hang, when in fact it is trying to
  manipulate the audio subsystem and failing.  You may or may not
  receive error messages indicating that the source of the error is the
  audio subsystem.

  You can not use [1mxawtv [22mto determine if your audio is working correctly,
  since [1mxawtv [22mis simply using the analog sound patched through line-in
  to line-out. It doesn't need to digitize the sound unless you are
  using the recording function.

  A better test to verify that sound will work for MythTV (and recording
  with [1mxawtv [22mfor that matter) is to startup [1mxawtv[22m, mute the line-in then
  run aplay /dev/dsp. You should hear the recorded audio slightly
  delayed behind the real-time video. You should see messages about
  "underrun". These can be ignored but they do confirm that the driver
  is loaded and there is an active device. Once this test succeeds,
  MythTV should work correctly because it writes to and read from
  /dev/dsp in the same way that [1maplay [22mdoes.

  To record audio along with video the audio signal must be digitized by
  a DSP so that the audio data can be stored in a file. On playback, the
  audio data is written to /dev/dsp and converted back to an analog
  signal. This analog signal should then be sent to your speakers. Here
  is what is needed in [1malsamixer[22m. If you are using an ALSA version after
  1.0.6, use [1malsamixer -V all[22m:

  CAPTUR source - the analog source to be sent to the DSP. This should
  be set to the input source from the tuner card to the sound card. In
  most cases this is Line but this could also be Aux, CD, Mic, etc.,
  depending on how you connect the input cable. This source should be
  muted to prevent patching through the analog sound. The volume of this
  source will not affect the record level.

  Capture mixer - this sets the level for the analog to digital
  recording.  While a volume of 100% is recommended for testing,
  distortion may occur.  Lowering this level to 75% to 85% may result in
  better audio quality.  "Capture" should be marked as the CAPTUR
  destination.

  PCM mixer - this sets the level for the digital to analog playback.
  While a volume of 100% is recommended for testing, distortion may
  occur. Lowering this level to 75% to 85% may result in better audio
  quality.

  Master mixer - sets the level for the analog signal sent to line-out
  or the speakers.

  You may also want to ensure that /dev/dsp , or whatever device file is
  being used, hasn't already been grabbed by another process, like [1mesd[0m
  or [1martsd[22m.  If the device file isn't available, then MythTV won't work.
  You may wish to run [1mconfigure [22mand enable support for these.

  If you wish to see what application is grabbing a resource, you can
  use the fuser command:


       # fuser -v /dev/dsp



  To disable aRts in KDE, go to KDE->Control Center->Sound->Sound System
  and uncheck the "Start aRts soundserver on KDE startup" box.  Run #
  killall artsd from the command line to stop the artsd program.

  If you're using multiple sound cards and multiple tuners, use
  alsamixer -c 1 to work with the second sound card.  The first card is
  #0, the second card is #1, etc.


  [1m22.5.6.  Mythbackend reports that your card is not reporting full[0m
  [1mduplex capabilities[0m

  [1m22.5.7.  The mythbackend program told me to look at this section[0m

  mythbackend does a check to see if your sound device is capable of
  full duplex operation.  If it's not, it's most likely that you're
  going to run into issues when you try to record and play sound at the
  same time.  If your backend is a separate machine than your frontend,
  then there's no problem, since you're only going to be doing one thing
  at a time with the card.  Likewise, if you're running the frontend and
  backend on the same machine, but you're using btaudio or a hardware
  encoder card such as the Hauppauge PVR-250, DVB cards or HDTV capture
  cards as your recording source and you're only using the playback
  function of your sound card, then you also shouldn't have an issue,
  since the sound card isn't being asked to perform two functions at
  once.

  If you can't get your sound card to go full-duplex and need it to,
  then check your distribution for updated sound drivers.  If your sound
  card is not capable of full-duplex operation, either because the
  drivers don't support it, or it has been designed that way, then
  you're pretty much out of luck and will either need to purchase a new
  sound card, or will need to get btaudio ``operational''.


  [1m22.5.8.  My remote doesn't work / works sometimes and not others /[0m
  [1m"ghost" keypresses[0m

  This can be due to a number of factors.  The simplest case is the
  "ghost" keypresses.  For me, it was due to compact fluorescent lights
  in the same room as the IR receiver, which the receiver was picking up
  as keypresses.  Once the lights were switched to incandescent bulbs,
  the ghost went away.

  You may have an issue with [1mlirc [22mmisinterpreting IR commands from a

  patterns are being seen by the IR receiver.

  If your remote has been properly configured, and [1mirw [22mand [1mirxevent [22mare

  not giving focus correctly to the various Myth programs as they run.

  +o  blackbox  (using "Sloppy Focus" and "Focus New Windows")

  [1mNOTE[22m:  You do not need to use [1mirxevent [22mif you are using MythTV's
  native LIRC support, so the window manager focus issue does not apply
  in that case.

  [1m22.5.10.  Channels are off by one[0m

  There is no such thing as "Canada Cable"; Canada uses the same
  frequencies as the United States.  "Canada Cable" was a hack that some
  people used when they would discover that their channels were off-by-
  one, i.e. when tuning to channel 42, they might get channel 41 or 43.
  This is actually due to the tuner on the video capture device being
  mis-detected.  You must manually specify the tuner type in your
  /etc/modules.conf.  See the video4linux mailing list
  (https://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/video4linux-list

  [1m22.5.15.  Screen goes black when you try to play something[0m

  MythTV prints error and status messages to the shell that was used to

  [1m23.  Miscellaneous.[0m

  [1m23.1.  I'd like to watch the files without using MythTV / I'd like to[0m
  [1mconvert the files to some other format[0m

  First, check if the [1mmytharchive [22mplugin does what you want.  If not,
  then read on:

  MythTV comes with a utility called [1mmythtranscode [22mwhich can decode nuv
  files into raw format for use with other applications.  This command-
  line utility was not designed to be used by the end-user, but instead
  to be called by other applications or scripts.  Programs like
  [1mnuvexport [22m(http://forevermore.net/myth/
  <http://forevermore.net/myth/>) are better suited for the end user.
  However, since [1mmythtranscode [22mcan be a useful tool, directions on using
  it follow.

  [1mmythtranscode [22mcreates raw streams, which means that they do not
  contain any container information such as resolution, frame-rate, or
  audio sampling rate.  In order to process the output, you must supply
  this information to the processing utility.  [1mmythtranscode [22mprovides
  the relevant information on STDOUT.

  There are two modes in which [1mmythtranscode [22mcan create raw streams.
  The first has no synchronization and assumes that the processing
  utility will read audio and video at a constant rate.  This method is
  useful when a single application will be processing the raw output,
  such as [1mmencoder [22mor [1mffmpeg[22m.  The second method assumes that two
  separate applications will be processing the audio and video streams
  independently, and there is no rate control between them which means
  that the two programs don't coordinate their efforts to maintain
  synchronization.


  [1m23.1.1.  mythtranscode example[0m

  First, start [1mmythtranscode[22m.  You will need to determine the channel
  and the start time manually.


       $ mythtranscode --chanid 1036 --starttime 2003-10-20T15:30:00 --profile \
       autodetect --fifodir . &



  When [1mmythtranscode [22mbegins executing, it will create two FIFOs
  ("audout" and "vidout") in the directory specified (in this case ".",
  meaning the current directory) and will print out information about
  the video stream.

  The next step is to start the processing application.  The following
  assumes that the stream is NTSC 640x480 with 32Kbps audio.

  To use [1mmencoder [22myou would enter a command like:


       mencoder -audiofile audout -audio-demuxer 20 -rawaudio rate=32000 \
       -rawvideo on:w=640:h=480:fps=29.97 -ovc lavc -oac mp3lame -o out.avi \
       vidout



          [1mNOTE[22m: You must use mencoder 1.0PRE1 or later. [1mmencoder[0m
  version 0.9x [4mWILL[24m [4mNOT[24m [4mWORK![24m  Using ffmepg:


       ffmpeg -f u16le -ar 32000 -ac 2 -i audout -f rawvideo -s 640x480 -r 29.97 \
       -i vidout -vcodec mpeg4 -b 2000 -acodec mp3 -ab 128 out.avi



  Or to play directly using mplayer (again 1.0PRE1 or later is needed):


       mplayer -audiofile audout -audio-demuxer 20 -rawaudio rate=32000 \
       -rawvideo on:w=640:h=480:fps=29.97 vidout



  If you wanted to write the raw data to separate audio and video files
  for later processing, the following would work (note the use of
  --fifosync for rate-control):


       $ mythtranscode --chanid 1036 --starttime 2003-10-20T15:30:00 \
       --profile autodetect --fifodir . --fifosync &
       $ cat audout > audio.raw &
       $ cat vidout > video.yuv



  [1m23.2.  Using a different window manager[0m

  MythTV is not dependent on any particular window manager.  If you wish
  to run a lightweight window manager, the contrib/configfiles/
  directory has an example of a .twmrc and .fvwmrc file you may use.


  [1m23.3.  What capture resolution should I use?  How does video work?[0m

  While MythTV allows you to set various GUI and capture resolutions,
  not all combinations make sense.

  First, analog video signals have a defined vertical resolution.  In
  NTSC, the video standard specifies that there are 525 vertical scan
  lines.  Once the "extra" lines are removed (they're used to
  synchronize the video signal, and encode closed captioning data), you
  have 480 horizontal lines stacked vertically.

  In PAL, there are 625 "raw" lines of resolution, with a net of 576
  horizontal lines stacked vertically.

  Horizontally, the maximum value allowed for a Bt8X8 chip is 720.
  However, due to limitations in the chip and other limitations of
  broadcast television, there may not be a noticeable improvement in
  image quality beyond 400 or 500 pixels.

  With this in mind, there are certain commonly accepted values for
  resolution.  While other values may be accepted for the vertical
  resolution, they will cause scan lines to be repeated or dropped.

  From "best" to "worst", in NTSC:

  +o  720x480 "DVD" resolution. ReplayTV High and medium resolution

  +o  704x480 DVD standalone recorder standard resolution

  +o  640x480 4:3

  +o  544x480 TiVo Best resolution

  +o  480x480 SuperVCD (SVCD) Video CD resolution, TiVo High resolution

  +o  352x480 ReplayTV "Standard" quality, TiVo Basic and Medium
     resolution, DVD "LP" resolution

  +o  320x480

  +o  544x240

  +o  480x240

  +o  352x240 Video CD (VCD) resolution

  +o  320x240

  As you can see, the lower quality values are half of the better ones.
  720x240 is possible, but isn't a good tradeoff relative to the number
  of vertical lines lost.  In a PAL country, the you would use values
  like 720x576 or x288.

  The higher resolutions will be more CPU intensive if you're using
  software encoding (PVR-250/350 will have minimal host CPU impact even
  if you're using 720x480). If the CPU is overtaxed, frames will be
  dropped causing uneven motion. You will likely see the best results at
  resolutions which average at least 10% CPU idle time.  You can use
  system tools such as top or sar to check the CPU % idle while
  recording.  If the CPU average usage is consistently exceeding 90%,
  frames will need to be dropped during peak times when more than 100%
  of the available CPU would be needed to process all of the frames.

  [1m23.4.  MythTV GUI and X Display Sizes[0m

  MythTV is designed to be run as dedicated full screen TV application
  but can also be run as a desktop application on a computer monitor.
  Here are a few consideration for configuring sizes to best suit you
  needs.


  [1m23.4.1.  X Dimensions[0m

  For output to a Television, common resolutions are 640x480, 800x600,
  and some rare devices support 1024x768. Generally, higher resolutions
  are better. However, you may find that you prefer the picture quality
  at one of the lower resolutions. Everything in MythTV is scalable and
  should 'fit' regardless of the resolution you choose.

  Edit your X configuration file, usually /etc/X11/XF86Config-4 for
  XFree, or /etc/X11/xorg.conf for Xorg, so that the resolution you want
  to use is listed first in the lists under "Screen". If this resolution
  is higher than the resolutions supported by your output device, you
  will see a 'panning' effect where moving the mouse to the edge will
  scroll around a desktop area which is larger than the display size. If
  this happens, edit your X configuration file to match the display size
  then restart X.


  [1m23.4.2.  MythTV Dimensions[0m

  From "mythfrontend" go to Setup->Appearance.  The default for the
  height and width is "0" - this will cause MythTV to automatically size
  itself to full screen.

  If the MythTV GUI width and height are not 0, mythfrontend uses these
  GUI dimensions and is anchored to the upper left corner of the X
  Desktop. If the GUI X and/or Y are not 0, the upper left corner is
  positioned at the specified coordinates. If the "Run the frontend in a
  window" box is checked, the window will have a frame and can then be
  dragged to any position on the desktop.



      [1mNOTE[22m: When the GUI is full screen, you may see windows rapidly
  flipping on top of each other. If this happens you will need to set
  your window manager to 'Click to Focus' for windows to stack properly.
  The fonts for the GUI and OSD will scale to whatever sizes you use.
  Most font sizes can be changed in setup selections or in the .xml
  files under /usr/local/share/mythtv/ . Make sure to use fonts large
  enough to be read on a TV screen from a distance.

  The full screen TV size is based on the X display size. For Xinerama,
  you can specify a screen in Setup->General. The TV picture will be
  stretched to fit the entire GUI area regardless of the ``capture
  resolutions'' used. However, during playback, the "W" key can to used
  to correct differences between 16:9 and 4:3.
  [1m23.4.3.  Overscan Dimensions[0m

  Because picture edges can be ragged and screen edges aren't straight,
  Television is designed to project an image larger than the physical
  screen.  This is called "overscan". Underscan is fitting the entire
  image inside the screen. Underscan is useful for computer monitors so
  that toolbars and scrollbars at the edges can be seen.

  For best results, match the X display area as close as possible to the
  edges of the physical screen. This can only be adjusted by your tv-out
  device or by the settings for the television set. Many sets have these
  adjustments in a 'service mode'. If you cannot make these adjustments,
  there will be black borders around the edges of the X desktop, MythTV
  GUI and TV playback.

  MythTV has settings for "Overscan" in Setup->Playback. These can not,
  and do not, cause the image to display beyond the edge of the X
  display area. The purpose of these settings are to cut off rough edges
  and to expand the image so that objects will appear to be the same
  size as a normal overscanned TV picture.


  [1m23.5.  Saving or restoring the database[0m

  See the [1mmysqldump [22mmanpage for more information.


       $ mysqldump -u mythtv -pmythtv mythconverg -c > mythtv_backup.sql



  To restore: (assuming that you've dropped the database)


       $ mysql -u root
       mysql>create database mythconverg;
       mysql>exit
       $ mysql -u mythtv -pmythtv mythconverg < mythtv_backup.sql



  You may need to alter the MySQL permissions if this database is being
  shared with multiple systems.  See the ``Modifying access to the MySQL
  database for multiple systems'' section for more information.


  [1m23.6.  Deleting the MySQL database[0m



  [1mNOTE[22m:  Performing this step will remove the entire database. You will
   lose all of your settings and will need to re-run the mc.sql script
  to setup the database structure before running the mythtv-setup
  program.


       $ mysql -u root
       mysql> drop database mythconverg;
       mysql> quit


  [1m23.7.  Moving your data to new hardware[0m

  This assumes that you will be moving your data to newer / bigger
  hardware and don't want to lose your programs.

  The first step is to create a database backup as demonstrated in an
  earlier section.

  Next, you will extract only the data that is relevant to the programs:


       $ grep "INSERT INTO record "          mythtv_backup.sql > restore.sql
       $ grep "INSERT INTO recorded "        mythtv_backup.sql >> restore.sql
       $ grep "INSERT INTO oldrecorded "     mythtv_backup.sql >> restore.sql
       $ grep "INSERT INTO recordedprogram " mythtv_backup.sql >> restore.sql
       $ grep "INSERT INTO recordedrating "  mythtv_backup.sql >> restore.sql
       $ grep "INSERT INTO recordedmarkup "  mythtv_backup.sql >> restore.sql
       $ grep "INSERT INTO recordedseek "    mythtv_backup.sql >> restore.sql



  [1mNOTE[22m:  Newer versions of [1mmysqldump [22mplace backticks around the table
  names.  Backticks are not the same as apostrophes!  On a typical North
  American keyboard, backticks are located to the left of the "1" key,
  on the same key as the tilde.  Also, because the [1mbash [22mshell may try to
  interpret the backticks, make sure you use a \ before each one.

  If your restore.sql file is empty, you'll need to re-run the commands
  like this:


       $ grep "INSERT INTO \`record\` "          mythtv_backup.sql > restore.sql
       $ grep "INSERT INTO \`recorded\` "        mythtv_backup.sql >> restore.sql
       $ grep "INSERT INTO \`oldrecorded\` "     mythtv_backup.sql >> restore.sql
       $ grep "INSERT INTO \`recordedprogram\` " mythtv_backup.sql >> restore.sql
       $ grep "INSERT INTO \`recordedrating\` "  mythtv_backup.sql >> restore.sql
       $ grep "INSERT INTO \`recordedmarkup\` "  mythtv_backup.sql >> restore.sql
       $ grep "INSERT INTO \`recordedseek\` "    mythtv_backup.sql >> restore.sql



  Note the space after the table name and the ">>" to append to the file
  for all but the first [1mgrep[22m. "recordedmarkup" and "recordedseek" are
  huge and there may be hundreds of thousands of lines if you had lots
  of hours of recordings.

  After you have moved the data files to the new hardware, configure
  MythTV using the [1mmythtv-setup [22mprogram as you normally would with a
  standard MythTV installation.

  At this point we will restore the information about your programs back
  into the database:


       $ mysql -u mythtv -pmythtv mythconverg < restore.sql



  After successful insertion of the data you may delete the restore.sql
  file.



  [1m23.8.  btaudio[0m

  btaudio allows you to obtain the audio data from your tuner card
  directly over the PCI bus without using a sound card.  This is useful
  if you would like to use multiple tuner cards in a system without
  adding a sound card for each one, or if your existing sound card is
  not capable of full-duplex operation.

  In order to use btaudio, your tuner card will need certain hardware
  installed on it, and that hardware must be wired correctly.  The chip
  that will allow you to use the btaudio module is the MSP34xx.
  However, having a MSP34xx is no guarantee that you will be able to use
  the btaudio module.

  As of 2003-03-31, this is the current list of cards and their status:
  Works with btaudio:


  +o  Hauppauge WinTV-radio with dbx-TV stereo, model 401

  +o  Hauppauge WinTV-Theater, model 495, 498 (Europe)

  +o  ATI TV Wonder

  The following cards do not work:

  +o  Pinnacle Studio PCTV Pro - note: this has a MSP34xx, but it's not
     wired correctly to the BT878 chip.

  +o  ATI TV Wonder VE

  +o  Leadtek Winfast 2000 XP (PAL, UK and NTSC)

  +o  I/O Magic PC-PVR.  No MSP34xx chip.

  The following cards have been reported to work, but have issues:

  +o  Avermedia AVerTV Studio (no digital DSP output, "whiney noise" on
     analog)

  Once btaudio loads, it should register additional /dev/dsp and
  /dev/mixer devices.  Typing $ dmesg will let you know what's going on.


  [1m23.9.  Removing unwanted channels[0m

  If [1mmythfilldatabase [22mgrabbed a channel which you do not want to include
  in your TV listings, you can remove the entries from the grabber
  configuration and the MySQL database.  This often happens with premium
  channels; for example, HBO or Showtime may be available on your cable
  TV system, but is scrambled because you're not a subscriber to that
  channel.  Since you can never watch it, you want to get rid of it.

  If you are using the DataDirect service, login to your account at
  http://labs.zap2it.com/ <http://labs.zap2it.com/> to modify your
  lineup. Uncheck the boxes for any unwanted channels, and they will no
  longer be included in your download.

  If you are using a grabber from XMLTV, comment out the channel from
  the ~/.mythtv/<sourcename>.xmltv file by inserting the word "not "
  (including the space) in front of the unwanted entry. This will
  prevent [1mxmltv [22mfrom grabbing future listings.

  Next, delete the unwanted item from the channel table so that it will
  not appear in the EPG or when changing channels.  To delete the data
  from the database we need to perform some steps.  First, assuming that
  HBO is channel 15, we need to find out the internal chanid used by
  MySQL:


       $ mysql -u root mythconverg
       mysql> select chanid from channel where channum=15;
       +--------+
       | chanid |
       +--------+
       |   1015 |
       +--------+
       1 row in set (0.00 sec)
       mysql> delete from channel where chanid = 1015;



  Old program data will be removed over the course of a week. However,
  you may want to immediately delete any current program listings for
  the channel that has been removed:


       $ mysql -u root mythconverg
       mysql> delete from program where chanid = 1015;



  [1m23.10.  NFS[0m

  You may want to use a central server to store your files.

  On the host machine, (in this case, the hostname is "masterbackend")
  you'll want to edit your /etc/exports file and use something like:


       /var/video (rw)



  To export the /var/video directory with read / write privileges.

  On the "slave" machine, you'll want to edit the /etc/fstab file and
  add something like:


       masterbackend:/var/video /var/video nfs rsize=8192,wsize=8192,hard,intr,nfsvers=3,actimeo=0



  Then run # mount -a to re-read the file to mount the file system.

  In this case, the source is a machine called "masterbackend" which is
  exporting the directory "/var/video", which we're mounting locally at
  "/var/video".  The rsize and wsize options are used to increase the
  performance of NFS; "hard,intr" is there because that's the
  recommendation of the NFS-HOWTO, the nfsvers is required for filesizes
  over 2GB and actimeo is used to turn off file attribute caching.
  Attribute caching for a shared media point causes problems; you always
  want to see the latest state of the directory and files.  See
  http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/index.php/Optimizing_Performance
  <http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/index.php/Optimizing_Performance> for
  additional information regarding performance optimization.

  [1m23.12.  Automatically starting mythbackend at system boot time[0m

  [1m23.12.1.  Red Hat And Mandriva[0m

  Here's a method for automatically starting mythbackend submitted by
  Mike Thomson (mailto:linux@m-thomson.net <mailto:linux@m-thomson.net>)
  and Stu Tomlinson (mailto:stu@nosnilmot.com
  <mailto:stu@nosnilmot.com>).

  Copy the files from the MythTV contrib directory or from Mike's web
  site (http://m-thomson.net/mythtv/ <http://m-thomson.net/mythtv/>) as
  follows:

  etc.rc.d.init.mythbackend should be made executable and copied to
  /etc/rc.d/init.d/:


       $ cd contrib
       $ su
       # chmod a+x etc.rc.d.init.d.mythbackend
       # cp etc.rc.d.init.d.mythbackend /etc/rc.d/init.d/mythbackend



  etc.sysconfig.mythbackend should be copied to /etc/sysconfig/:


       $ cd contrib
       $ su
       # cp etc.sysconfig.mythbackend /etc/sysconfig/mythbackend



  Edit /etc/sysconfig/mythbackend if you want to change the defaults
  (the userid that should start mythbackend, location of the logfile and
  (if required) the name and location of the mythbackend binary).

  Use [1mchkconfig [22mto make sure the script is called when entering
  runlevels 3, 4 or 5:


       $ su
       # chkconfig --level 345 mythbackend on
       # exit
       $



  [1m23.12.1.1.  Log files[0m

  By default, the log file for mythbackend will be written to
  /var/tmp/mythbackend.log. This has been tested and is known to work on
  Mandriva and Red Hat, but many people prefer to place logs under
  /var/log/.

  To do this, create a group called mythtv (or anything you prefer) and
  add your usual MythTV users to that group. If you changed the user
  that starts mythbackend from the default of root you [4mmust[24m perform this
  step.

  Create the directory /var/log/mythtv and set its permissions as
  follows:


       $ su
       # mkdir /var/log/mythtv
       # chown root:mythtv /var/log/mythtv
       # chmod 0775 /var/log/mythtv
       # exit
       $ ls -ld /var/log/mythtv
       drwxrwxr-x    2 root     mythtv       4096 Apr 28 21:58 /var/log/mythtv/
       $



  Create a mythtv file in /etc/logrotate.d:



  $ su
  # cat > /etc/logrotate.d/mythtv
  # Set default values for all log files first...

  # Rotate the logs once a week, or more frequently if they
  # exceed 10Mb in size (size is checked daily).

  # sets the length of the existing file to 0.  The only time
  # this would break would be if the program writing the log
  # was using lseek.

  [1m23.12.1.2.  Mandriva[0m

  Mandriva adds one more twist in the form of the msec utility, which
  runs regularly and (at the default or any higher security level) sets
  permissions on many files, including those under /var/log.

  To tell msec about the MythTV log files and their directory, you need
  to edit the /etc/security/msec/perm.local file to include the
  following:



  # /etc/security/msec/perm.local
  # Local overrides to the msec program
  #
  # Full file path                user.group              permissions
  /var/log/mythtv/                root.mythtv             775
  /var/log/mythtv/*               root.mythtv             664



  A copy of the above has been included in the contrib/ directory.  You
  may add it by typing:


       $ cd contrib
       $ su
       # cat etc.security.msec.perm.local >> /etc/security/msec/perm.local
       # exit



  Finally run the msec tool to check and implement your changes.


       $ su
       # msec
       # exit
       $



        [1mNOTE[22m: msec can only [4mreduce[24m the permissions of files, so if
  you don't get the results you expect, check that you're not asking
  msec to add missing permissions to the files or directories you
  created.

  [1m23.12.2.  Gentoo[0m

  The portage file for MythTV has scripts that will allow you to run
  mythbackend at startup.

  To run mythbackend as a daemon which starts at boot time:


       # rc-update add mythbackend default

       # /etc/init.d/mythbackend stop



  To obtain a list of options:

  # /etc/init.d/mythbackend



  [1m23.13.  Advanced Backend Configurations[0m

  MythTV is flexible in the way that you define multiple backend tuner
  configurations.  The only hard-and-fast rule is that the Master
  backend [4mmust[24m have a capture device defined, but shouldn't imply that
  the capture device in the Master backend must be the first capture
  card defined in the database.

  One example of an advanced configuration is the round-robin scheme.
  Rather than defining all of the cards on the master, you could first
  go into mythtv-setup on the master to define globals such as the
  general configuration and the channel lineup but not the host-specific
  configuration item like the capture card.  In this example, we will
  use a 4 tuner configuration, where two slaves have one card each and
  the master has two.

  1. Add the first capture card on one of the slaves.  Complete the
     configuration, connecting the input source to the card.  This will
     get cardid #1 in the database.  Exit mythtv-setup.

  2. Configure the first capture card on the master backend.  This will
     get cardid #2 in the database.  Exit mythtv-setup.

  3. Configure the first capture card on the second slave.  This will be
     cardid #3 in the database.  Exit mythtv-setup.

  4. Configure the second capture card on the master backend.  This will
     get cardid #4 in the database.  Exit mythtv-setup.

  Using this scheme, the master backend will not use both capture cards
  until one of the following happens:

  +o  There are four recordings scheduled for the same time

  +o  Both slaves are unavailable

  The scheduler in MythTV checks whether an encoder is available; if a
  slave backend isn't running, its encoder isn't available, so the
  scheduler will look for the next available encoder.  This makes MythTV
  very flexible; slave tuners can come and go, and as long as there are
  enough tuners for what you'd like to record it doesn't matter which
  tuner in particular is going to be used.

  Using this round-robin scheme along with a shared storage directory
  like NFS and enabling the Master Backend Override setting will allow
  you to view content even if the slave backend that recorded a program
  is not available.


  [1m23.14.  Using the transcoder[0m

  MythTV's built-in transcoder re-encodes recordings from one codec to
  another.  The transcoder has three primary uses; it can transcode
  MPEG-2 files captured using a hardware encoder (PVR cards, DVB cards,
  ATSC HD, etc.) to MPEG-4, it can be used to transcode RTjpeg files
  (usually only used on systems that can not real-time encode to MPEG-4
  using a framegrabber) to MPEG-4, and finally it can be used to remove
  commercials from a MPEG-2 file while leaving the file in MPEG-2
  format.

  When MythTV transcodes a file to MPEG-4 or RTjpeg the resulting file
  format is NuppelVideo (nuv).  NuppelVideo is a container which
  provides a method of keeping the audio and video in sync throughout
  the recording, which is why it is used instead of the .avi format.
  You may have difficulty playing .nuv files in non-MythTV systems.


  The original file is removed when the transcoding process is complete.
  Unless you're sure that you will be satisfied with the result you may
  want to enable the [1mmythtv-setup [22moption which causes [1mmythbackend [22mto
  keep the original file after transcoding.  This option is on the
  second page of the General section in mythtv-setup.  Enabling this
  allows you to compare the two files and restore the original if you
  like.  Outside of the initial setup phase it usually isn't necessary
  to leave this option enabled.  A recording can be transcoded in two
  ways:


  +o  Automatically transcode the file once it has completed recording.

  +o  Manually choosing to transcode a recording, usually after importing
     a cutlist or manually marking commercials to be removed.

  The second method can be used on files that have already been
  transcoded (or files which were are already in the desired format), so
  only the frames immediately following a cut section will be re-
  encoded, resulting in a minimal loss of quality when removing
  commercials with the added benefit of being extremely quick.

  The current transcoding system has a lot flexibility, but there are a
  number of steps involved in setting it up.  In order to automatically
  transcode a given recording you must do the following:

  1. Configure recording profile for your capture source and enable
     transcoding on one or more profiles.

  2. Configure one or more transcoding profiles.

  3. Create or alter existing scheduled recordings to enable transcoding
     for that recording.


  [1m23.14.1.  Configuring Recording Profiles to Allow Transcoding[0m

  Enter the Utilities/Setup > Setup > TV Settings > Recording Profiles
  section in [1mmythfrontend[22m.  Choose the option that corresponds to your
  capture source (ignore the Transcoders for now.) Choose the quality
  profile you are interested in using for transcoding.  Ensure that
  "Enable auto-transcode after recording" is checked.


  [1m23.14.2.  Configure Transcoding Profiles[0m

  Enter the Recording Profiles > Transcoders menu.  There are three
  quality settings to choose from and a two special Autodetect settings.
  Later, when scheduling recordings you'll have to choose one of
  Autodetect, High, Medium, and Low Quality transcode settings in
  addition to the recording profile we set up above.  If you choose the
  Autodetect transcoding profile for a recording, MythTV will use the
  "Autodetect from RTjpeg/MPEG-4" profile for recordings which are
  RTjpeg/MPEG-4 files.  Otherwise, it will use the "Autodetect from
  MPEG-2" profile provided it's an MPEG-2 recording.  If you choose one
  of the others (High, Medium, Low) it will use the settings in that
  profile regardless of the codec of the original recording.


  There are a number of options for transcoding but the simplest is to
  enable lossless transcoding (the first option) which subsequently
  removes all other options. Enabling lossless encoding simply removes
  commercials (if you've marked them) and attempts to clean up MPEG-2
  streams.  Note that with this option MythTV will not apply any sort of
  filters and will only attempt to normalize the stream into something
  cleaner and less likely to have trouble with other less forgiving
  MPEG-2 hardware/software (including players, video editors, etc.)

  If you enable resizing of the recording the next page has the settings
  for choosing the final resolution.  MythTV will scale the video as
  appropriate, not crop it to this resolution.

  The final two pages allow configuration of the video and audio codecs.
  Although RTjpeg is an option for video codec there is no reason to
  transcode [4mto[24m this format because it will produce larger files than
  MPEG-4 and the recording will take [4mmore[24m CPU power to play back.  The
  MPEG-4 settings are described in the documentation for the [1mffmpeg[0m
  project at http://ffmpeg.sourceforge.net/ffmpeg-doc.html
  <http://ffmpeg.sourceforge.net/ffmpeg-doc.html>.  It's a matter of
  trial and error to discover which settings achieve a good compromise
  between size and quality.

  If you wish to return to the default settings, they are Bitrate:
  2200-2500, MaxQ: 2, MinQ: 15, MaxQDiff: 3, and "Scale bitrate for
  frame size" is enabled.  The other options are unchecked.


  [1m23.14.3.  Create/Alter Scheduled Recordings to Enable Transcoding[0m

  Transcoding is actually enabled on a per-recording basis.  Two things
  must be true before any given recording will be auto-transcoded,
  however.  The first is that the recording must have been made with a
  recording profile that has auto-transcode enabled. Under "Storage
  Options" for the recording you must set the "Record using the "X"
  profile" to the profile you configured in the first step.  In
  addition, under the "Post Recording Options" section of the recording
  you must also set "Transcode new recordings." This is also where you
  specify the Transcoding profile to use (Auto, High, Medium, Low.)

  It may not be obvious from above but the flexibility of this system is
  primarily to make it possible to auto-transcode a show recorded via
  one source (ie: pcHDTV 3000), and not transcode that same show if it's
  recorded on another kind of card (ie: PVR-250.) There are other uses
  however.  You could have a PVR-250 and a V4L card.  You may want to
  transcode the MPEG-2 from the PVR-250 but there is no need to
  transcode the recordings made with the V4L card, as it's already
  likely to be MPEG-4.

  As an example, you could configure the Default profile for "Hardware
  DVB Encoders" (the profile group used for DVB cards, including ATSC
  cards like the pcHDTV 3000) to "Enable auto-transcoding". In the
  Default profile for MPEG-2 Encoders (PVR cards) you'd leave "Enable
  auto-transcoding" unchecked.  For programs that are available on both
  kinds of cards you'd set the recording profile to Default and enable
  auto-transcoding in the record settings.  Then you pick your
  transcoding profile.  The result is that when a program is recorded on
  your DVB card, it will get transcoded.  When it plays on a channel
  available via your PVR card, it won't be.


  [1m23.14.4.  Manual Transcoding[0m

  Manually transcoding is activated while watching a show by hitting
  'x', from the OSD menu by choosing the Transcode option, or by
  choosing Job Options/Transcode from the info menu from the Watch or
  Delete Recordings screens.

  The transcoding profile used for manual transcoding is whatever was
  set when the recording was originally configured, even if you didn't
  enable auto-transcoding.  The only way to change what transcoding
  profile will be used is to alter the transcoder column in the recorded
  table in the database.  The transcoder column contains a number which
  corresponds with the id column in the recordingprofiles table.  You
  can find out the id number for each profile in the transcoder group
  with an SQL command like:



       mysql> select r.* from recordingprofiles r,profilegroups p where p.name='Transcoders' and p.id=r.profilegroup;
       +----+----------------+------------+------------+--------------+
       | id | name           | videocodec | audiocodec | profilegroup |
       +----+----------------+------------+------------+--------------+
       | 21 | RTjpeg/MPEG4   | MPEG-4     | MP3        |            6 |
       | 22 | MPEG2          | MPEG-4     | MP3        |            6 |
       | 27 | High Quality   | MPEG-4     | MP3        |            6 |
       | 28 | Medium Quality | MPEG-4     | MP3        |            6 |
       | 29 | Low Quality    | MPEG-4     | MP3        |            6 |
       +----+----------------+------------+------------+--------------+
       5 rows in set (0.01 sec)

       mysql>



  Armed with the knowledge of what the profile ID's are you can also
  choose to run mythtranscode from the command line and explicitly
  specify the transcoder profile.  Run mythtranscode --help for usage
  information.


  [1m23.15.  Changing your hostname[0m

  If you need to change the name of the computers used with MythTV
  you'll need to perform a sequence of steps.  There are a number of
  pieces of information that MythTV keeps track of which are tied to the
  hostname of the box, so changing the hostname involves altering the
  name in the operating system and in the MySQL database.  In the
  examples below, the old name of the system was "frontend1" and we're
  going to change it to "kidsroom".



    [1mNOTE[22m:  Changing the hostname using direct SQL update commands will
  break things.  You [4mMUST[24m use this indirect method.

  1.  Stop all backends.  If you run [1mmythbackend [22mfrom a terminal
  session, press control-c. If your backends are started with an init
  script, you would do something like the following:


       $ su
       # /etc/init.d/mythbackend stop



  2.  Change the hostname.

  For Red Hat and derived distributions, edit the /etc/sysconfig/network
  file.  Look for HOSTNAME=frontend1 and change this to
  HOSTNAME=kidsroom or whatever you'll be using.  For other
  distributions, refer to the documentation, such as the

  hostname(1)



  To alter the hostname in the current session, run:


       # hostname kidsroom



  3.  Dump the database.


       $ mysqldump -u mythtv -pmythtv mythconverg -c > mythtv_backup.sql



  4.  Rename the host in the database.  First, ensure that the new
  hostname you'll be using isn't already in the database.


       $ grep kidsroom mythtv_backup.sql



  Now we're actually going to change the name.  The following should all
  be typed on the same line:


       $ cat mythtv_backup.sql | sed s/\'frontend1\'/\'kidsroom\'/g >> mythtv_restore.sql



  If you don't feel comfortable using [1msed[22m, you can open the
  mythtv_backup.sql file in a text editor and perform a global search
  and replace.  When saving the file, make sure you use the new name,
  mythtv_restore.sql or the rest of the steps below will fail.

  5.  Drop and recreate the database.


       $ mysql -u root
       mysql>drop database mythconverg;
       mysql>create database mythconverg;
       mysql>exit



  6.  Restore the database using your edited version.



  $ mysql -u mythtv -pmythtv mythconverg < mythtv_restore.sql



  If you are running slave backends or frontends, don't forget to re-
  enable access as detailed in ``Modifying access to the MySQL database
  for multiple systems''.

  7.  Start the backends.  If you use init scripts, do the following,
  otherwise start them from terminal consoles.


       # /etc/init.d/mythbackend start



  8.  Quit and restart all frontends.  Delete the mythtv_backup.sql and
  mythtv_restore.sql files.


  [1m23.16.  Can I run MythTV on my TiVo?[0m

  [1m23.17.  Can I run MythTV on my ReplayTV?[0m

  No.

  While it is true that the TiVo runs the Linux kernel, and TiVo has
  released their changes to the kernel under the GPL, the TiVo is [4mnot[24m a
  general-purpose computer, and there is no programming information
  available for the custom hardware contained within a TiVo.  TiVo is
  under no obligation to release the source code to their [4mapplication[24m.

  The ReplayTV runs VxWorks, a Real Time Operating System from Wind

  [1m23.18.  Can a wireless connection be used between the frontend and the[0m
  [1mbackend?[0m

  Yes, assuming that your wireless connection has sufficient bandwidth
  to maintain the datarate between the frontend and the backend.
  802.11b should be sufficient if the encoded bitrate of the content is
  less than the datarate of your wireless connection, which in the case
  of 802.11b would be approximately 4 Mbps.  (The advertised rate of
  11Mbps gives an actual throughput of 4 Mbps.) 802.11a and 802.11g, if
  operating in their high-speed modes, or proprietary 802.11b "Turbo"
  schemes should be adequate.  Multiple wireless frontends, poor signal
  strength or other factors can severely impact the viewing experience
  on the frontend.

  [1m23.20.  Using the DBoxII within MythTV[0m

  The configuration of the DBoxII for use within MythTV is tricky (as of
  May 16 2005), that's why it's covered here. Your DBoxII has to be
  running linux and the Neutrino GUI instead of the stock BetaNova
  firmware.  For further information, please refer to
  http://www.tuxbox.org <http://www.tuxbox.org>. Additionally, you need
  to enable the SPTS mode in Neutrino.

  +o  Add a new "Capture Card" in the setup. The "Card type" is "DBOX2
     Input", the other values have to be adjusted according to your
     setup.  The default values, except for the "DBOX2 host ip", should
     work fine.

  +o  Define a new video source. It doesn't need to be configured, you
     just need to define it. MythTV grabs the EPG from the DBoxII.

  +o  Connect the DBoxII to the newly defined input source in "input
     connections".

  +o  Since channel scanning is not implemented yet, you need to define
     channels in the "Channel Editor". Make sure that you use the same
     value for "Channel Name" as on the DBoxII. You can get a list of
     available channels from the web interface of Neutrino at http://ip-
     of-your-box:80/.  Associate the channel with your new video source
     and repeat when needed.

  You may leave the Setup now and proceed as usual.

  [1m23.23.  What is the difference between the various Hauppauge PVR mod-[0m
  [1mels?[0m

  This is covered in the hardware section, and extensively covered on
  the Hauppauge website.
  (http://www.hauppauge.com/pages/compare_pvr.html
  <http://www.hauppauge.com/pages/compare_pvr.html>) Please check the
  Hauppauge website for the most accurate information.

  A PVR-150 comes in a number of versions:

  +o  The PVR-150 (Model 1045) is the retail kit.  It comes with a remote
     control and an IR Blaster.  It does not have a radio tuner.

  +o  The PVR-150 MCE (Model 1042) will usually come in a plain white box
     and is sold as an OEM device.  It does not come with a remote
     control, since it's usually used as the second, third, etc capture
     device.
  +o  The PVR-150 MCE Kit (Model 1062) does not have a radio tuner and
     comes with a Microsoft Media Center remote control instead of
     Hauppauge's.

  +o  The PVR-150 low profile (Model 1086) is a low-profile card. It has
     a radio tuner and is approximately half the height of a standard
     card.  However, it comes with a low-profile PCI bracket, so it is
     not suitable for use in a standard PCI slot without removing the
     bracket, which may not be worth the trouble.

  A PVR-250 (Model 980) is a retail kit which comes with an IR receiver
  and a remote control.

  The PVR-250 MCE (Model 975) contains a FM radio tuner.  The PVR-250
  MCE does not contain a IR receiver or a remote.

  The PVR-250 Rev 1 contained an MPEG-2 decoder.  However, this function
  was not connected to any output jacks, and there doesn't appear to be
  any way to pull decoded video from the card, so it's a fairly useless
  feature.

  The PVR-350 (model 990) has the features of the PVR-250 as well as
  being able to decode MPEG-2.  The encode and decode functions may be
  used simultaneously.  The MPEG-2 decoder function gives superior video
  quality compared to what you'll find on a standard video card.
  However, the decoder function is only available once Linux has
  started, so you will not see any boot-time messages.  Also, the card
  is not capable of resolutions higher than 720x480, so it cannot be
  used with HDTV.  Make a conscious decision (and ask for advice on the
  mailing list) that you want to tradeoff potential HDTV use in the
  future compared to video quality.

  The X-driver for the PVR-350 support playback using Xv efficiently but
  does not support any other 2D or 3D acceleration. For some application
  this may place a large load on the host CPU, some will run without any
  problem and others (mplayer, xine, xmame etc.) should be configured to
  utilize the Xv interface.

  Note that for the PVR-350 there are some ``considerations'' regarding
  the way audio is handled.

  The PVR-500 is a dual-encoder version of the PVR-150 card, so you can
  simultaneously record two different programs at the same time, because
  there are two encoder chips on the PCI card.  Hauppuage has also
  installed an onboard splitter, so you can use one COAX to feed both
  tuners.  Current versions of the PVR-500 should come with an adapter
  to allow you to connect a second S-Video or composite input, but this
  will take up a second PCI slot.  Early adopters may need to purchase
  this item separately.


  [1m23.24.  Changing channels on an external Set Top Box[0m

  If you need to use an external Set Top Box (STB), such as for
  satellite TV or for digital cable you will need some way for MythTV to
  tell the STB to switch to a new channel.  There are several methods:

  1. Use an IR blaster.  An IR blaster is an infrared transmitter
     connected to your computer.  When MythTV needs to change channels
     it will send IR pulses, thereby emulating a remote control.

  2. Use a direct serial connection.  Some STB's have a serial port on
     the back, although it may not look like a serial port.  It may look
     like a phone jack, or a strange VGA connector.  It may be labeled
     "Low Speed Data".  A direct serial connection is more reliable than
     an IR blaster.  Not all STB's that have a Low Speed Data port have
     it enabled; you may need to convince your service provider to turn
     it on.  Stating that you have a Tivo may help; the Tivo has a
     direct-connect capability.

  3. Use a firewire connection.  There is a 6200ch.c in the MythTV
     contrib directory which may work for you.

  [1m23.25.  Configuring one machine to flag all commercials[0m

  Commercial flagging can be CPU intensive.  By default, the backend
  that created a recording is the one which will flag commercials.  You
  may wish to use a different machine to run commercial flagging.

  On the slower machine:

  Start the mythtv-setup program.  Advance through the pages until you
  get to the Job Queue page.  Turn off the setting that says "Allow
  Commercial Detection jobs", thereby preventing any commercial flagging
  jobs from running on this machine.

  Next, make sure that "Run Jobs only on original recording host" is
  turned OFF so that new jobs are allowed to run anywhere.

  Restart [1mmythbackend [22msince it only reads this setting when it starts
  up.

  On the faster machine:

  Start the [1mmythtv-setup [22mprogram.  Advance through the pages until you
  get to the Job Queue page.  Ensure that "Allow Commercial Detection
  jobs" is turned ON for this machine.

  Run [1mmythjobqueue[22m.  [1mmythjobqueue [22mwill examine the JobQueue and run any
  jobs it finds.  [1mmythjobqueue [22mshould be left running so that it will
  pick up any new commercial flagging jobs that are added to the queue,
  otherwise new jobs will be added to the queue and your programs won't
  be flagged until you run manually run [1mmythjobqueue[22m.

  Using this technique it's possible to add commercial flagging machines
  as needed, even on systems that aren't running a backend.  It's also
  possible to run the commercial flagger in a virtual machine
  environment such as VMWare.


  [1m24.  Example Configurations.[0m

  [1m24.1.  Logical Volume Manager (LVM)[0m

  LVM greatly increases the flexibility you have in managing your
  storage than traditional physical partitions. This section will
  provide some brief notes on how to use LVM to create storage space for
  your video files and how to add additional disk space in the future.
  There's lots more that can be done with LVM, so check the LVM HOWTO
  http://tldp.org/HOWTO/LVM-HOWTO/ <http://tldp.org/HOWTO/LVM-HOWTO/>
  document for details.



      [1mNOTE[22m:  If you are running MythTV 0.21 and you are using LVM to
  create one large filesystem to store your recordings, it's no longer
  recommended that you go the LVM route. The preferred solution is to
  use ``Storage Groups''.  They're more flexible and less likely to lose
  all of your recordings if you have a drive failure.

  If you don't understand how to partition a drive, or how to change the
  partition type you should stop and look at documentation on how to
  perform these steps.



    [1mBIG FAT WARNING[22m:  Using an incorrect parameter can make your files
  inaccessible, prevent your computer from booting, etc.  Be careful!

  Make sure your kernel configuration includes LVM support or that it's
  available as a module. Today, most vendors include this by default.
  You'll also want to ensure that you have a copy of the LVM utilities;
  check your distribution, or get the latest versions from
  http://www.sistina.com/products_lvm.htm
  <http://www.sistina.com/products_lvm.htm> and build them manually.

  Check that the [1mvgscan [22mprogram is being run at some point during your
  boot sequence - most distributions do this by default. Look for a
  message during boot up that looks like this: vgscan -- reading all
  physical volumes (this may take a while...) If you don't see any
  messages during boot, you may need to install a LVM init script or
  confirm that you have all of the LVM packages installed from your
  distribution.

  LVM uses a few concepts you should be familiar with before starting.

  +o  PV (Physical Volume).  The actual partition on the hard drive.

  +o  VG (Volume Group).  The aggregation of all the PVs make a VG.

  +o  LV (Logical Volume).  Subdivision of the pool of space available in
     the VG into individual chunks, like /usr, /var/video, etc.

  The following example assumes that you want to create a LVM partition
  from a chunk of space in /dev/hda5, using a reiserfs filesystem and
  mounted on /var/video. You later decide to extend this filesystem by
  adding a new disk: /dev/hdb.

  You need to create at least one LVM partition for a physical volume.
  Use [1mfdisk [22mor your favorite partition editor to set the type to LVM
  (0x8e). If you're using an entire disk, create one big partition
  rather than using the device itself. e.g. use /dev/hdb1 not /dev/hdb.

  In the following example, you have a 15GB disk.  The first 6GB are set
  as your boot partition.  /dev/hda2 was added as an extended partition,
  and within that partition you created the /dev/hda5 linux (ext2)
  partition.



  # fdisk /dev/hda

  The number of cylinders for this disk is set to 1823.
  There is nothing wrong with that, but this is larger than 1024,
  and could in certain setups cause problems with:
  1) software that runs at boot time (e.g., old versions of LILO)
  2) booting and partitioning software from other OSs
     (e.g., DOS FDISK, OS/2 FDISK)

  #



  Create the LVM physical volume from the partitions (repeat if you have
  multiple partitions to use):


       # pvcreate /dev/hda5



  Create a LVM volume group out of this physical volume called
  "VGforMyth" that is allocated in chunks that are a multiple of 64MB


       # vgcreate VGforMyth -s 64m /dev/hda5



  Create a logical volume of 5GB called "video" and then create the
  reiserfs filesystem and mount it:



  # lvcreate --name video --size 5G VGforMyth
  # mkreiserfs /dev/VGforMyth/video
  # mount /dev/VGforMyth/video /var/video



  Now create a 3GB volume for mythmusic files if you like:


       # lvcreate --name music --size 3G VGforMyth
       # mkreiserfs /dev/VGforMyth/music
       # mount /dev/VGforMyth/music /var/music



  Display the volume group status: # vgdisplay -v

  Now, lets suppose you want to add a 60GB hard disk to the system as
  hdb and allocate 50GB of it to video storage.

  First, create a single partition /dev/hdb1 covering the whole disk and
  make it type 0x8e using your partition editor.

  # fdisk /dev/hdb .... create partition, set type, save and reboot if
  it says you have to

  Create the new LVM physical volume:

  # pvcreate /dev/hdb1

  Add the new physical volume to the volume group:

  # vgextend VGforMyth /dev/hdb1



    [1mNOTE[22m:  You may get errors at this point stating that there are no
  physical volumes available for adding to the LV, even though you know
  for a fact that there are.  You may need to specify the physical
  volume in the /dev/ide/host/bus/target/lun/etc format.  Once you've
  completed one of the following two procedures, use [1mdf [22mto check that
  you've got more space.

  Make the logical volume used for video bigger:

  # lvextend --size +50G /dev/VGforMyth/video

  [1m24.1.1.  ReiserFS[0m

  Unmount, resize and remount the filesystem.  Technically, you don't
  need to unmount and remount the ReiserFS.


       # umount /var/video
       # resize_reiserfs /dev/VGforMyth/video
       # mount /dev/VGforMyth/video /var/video



  [1m24.1.2.  ext2 or ext3[0m

  LVM comes with a program called [1mresize2fs[22m.

  Unmount, resize and remount the filesystem.  The filesystem [4mmust[24m be
  unmounted during this procedure.


       # umount /var/video
       # resize2fs --size +50G /dev/VGforMyth/video
       # mount /dev/VGforMyth/video /var/video



  [1m24.1.3.  xfs[0m

  XFS does not need to be unmounted to extend the size:


       # xfs_growfs /var/video



  [1m24.2.  Advanced Partition Formatting[0m

  The partitions that your distribution sets up for you may not be
  optimized for large files. Using LVM in conjunction with the following
  techniques can be quite useful.

  Unlike a typical filesystem, a MythTV video partition is usually a
  very large filesystem filled with a fairly small number of large
  files.  Filesystem I/O is usually not an issue, even in multi-tuner
  and/or multi-frontend setups.

  There is however, one aspect of filesystem performance that can have a
  bearing on the performance of MythTV.  In Linux, deleting a file will
  utilize I/O bandwidth until the deletion has been completed.  If
  deleting the file takes long enough, the video capture buffer may
  overrun, thereby resulting in dropped frames.  Some filesystems are
  faster at deleting files than others and, for multi-gigabyte MythTV
  video files, these differences can be significant.

  Fortunately, there are published tests
  (http://aurora.zemris.fer.hr/filesystems/big.html
  <http://aurora.zemris.fer.hr/filesystems/big.html>) that provide
  insight into filesystem performance under conditions relevant to
  MythTV usage.  In addition, some limited testing (archived at
  http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/mythtv/users/52672
  <http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/mythtv/users/52672>) with very
  large files (10 gigabytes) was reported in the MythTV Users mailing
  list.


  [1m24.2.1.  Ext2[0m

  Ext2 was the defacto standard Linux filesystem for many years.  It is
  stable, provides good I/O performance and can quickly delete large
  files.  The primary disadvantage of Ext2 is that it is not a
  journaling filesystem, so a file system consistency check (fsck, which
  is normally only performed after a system crash) can take many hours
  on a filesystem the size of a typical MythTV partition.



  [1m24.2.2.  Ext3[0m

  Ext3 is Ext2 with a journal, so your biggest gain is that in case of a
  crash and reboot you won't have to wait very long for your partition
  to be remounted.

  There are options available when formatting an Ext3 partition, as in:


       # mkfs.ext3 -T largefile4 /dev/hdb1



  This example assumes that /dev/hdb1 has already been created using
  [1mfdisk[22m. If you're using LVM, /dev/hdb1 may be something like
  /dev/VGforMyth/video.

  The "-T largefile4" option creates one inode per 4 megabytes, which
  can provide a few percent more storage space.  However, tests indicate
  that using the "-T largefile4" option can drastically increase the
  amount of time required to delete a large file and thus it should only
  be used with encoder settings that produce small video files (YMMV).

  You can check on your filesystem using the [1mdumpe2fs [22mprogram. See the
  man page for details.

  [1m24.2.3.  ReiserFS[0m

  The Reiser filesystem is another journaling filesystem commonly
  distributed with Linux.  It is known to be an extremely efficient
  filesystem and it especially excels at managing partitions containing
  a large number of small files.  However, tests indicate it is not the
  fastest at deleting very large files.  For that reason, it may not be
  the best choice when using encoder bitrates that produce very large
  files.


  [1m24.2.4.  JFS[0m

  JFS (Journaling File System) is a journaling filesystem originally
  developed by IBM for AIX which was later released as open source.
  While not as common as Ext3 or ReiserFS, it is distributed with RedHat
  9 (RH9), Fedora Core and Mandriva as well as other distros.  According
  to tests, JFS is the file deletion speed king, deleting virtually any
  file in under one second, even files as large as 10 gigabytes.


  [1m24.2.5.  XFS[0m

  XFS is a journaling file system originally developed by SGI for Irix,
  and later released as open source.  While not a part of the default
  RedHat Linux 9 or Fedora Core installation (although it is a part of
  Mandriva and Fedora Core 2+), it can be easily installed via ATrpms.
  XFS provides deletion speeds for large files only slightly slower than
  JFS.  According to the test results shown at
  (http://aurora.zemris.fer.hr/filesystems/big.html
  <http://aurora.zemris.fer.hr/filesystems/big.html>), XFS provide
  higher I/O rates than JFS, albeit at a higher CPU loading.  This may
  cause issues if you do not have the spare CPU capacity to handle XFS,
  potentially leading to dropped frames.



  [1m24.3.  Migrating from DataDirect Labs to Schedules Direct[0m

  MythTV v0.20.2 or later is required to natively support Schedules
  Direct.  Code has been included to make the transition as simple as
  possible.

  [1mYou do not need to delete your existing video sources or add new ones![0m

  The following steps should work for most users:

  +o  Create a Schedules Direct account and use the same information as
     your existing lineups at Zap2It Labs.  Do not add or delete
     channels at this time.

  +o  Shut down any running [1mmythfrontend [22mand [1mmythbackend [22mprograms.

  +o  Perform a backup of your existing database.  See ``Saving or
     restoring the database'' for instructions.

  +o  Run [1mmythtv-setup [22m-> Video Sources.  Change the grabber to Schedules
     Direct, update the username and password fields with the account
     information you created at Schedules Direct and select "Retrieve
     Lineups".  Click Finish.

  +o  Exit [1mmythtv-setup [22mand run [1mmythfilldatabase[22m.  Check if there were
     any errors.

  +o  Restart your [1mmythbackend [22mand [1mmythfrontend [22mprograms.


  [1m24.4.  Caching support for Schedules Direct[0m

  MythTV 0.20.2 or later supports caching of downloaded information from
  Schedules Direct, so devices that share a common source do not require
  multiple downloads.

  Before beginning, perform a backup of your existing database.  See
  ``Saving or restoring the database'' for instructions.

  In the following scenario, assume that you have the following:

  1. A PVR-150 MPEG-2 encoder card connected directly to a CATV source.

  2. A PVR-250 MPEG-2 encoder card connected via S-Video to a CATV Set
     Top Box.

  What we are going to do is to create a single lineup at Schedules
  Direct and then create two Video Sources which use the same login
  information but have different channels associated with them.

  On your Schedules Direct account, create a lineup that has all of the
  channels that you can receive.  Because we have a Set Top Box (STB),
  choose a Digital lineup.  Yes, this means that you may have 900
  channels in this lineup, but that's OK.

  Use the Schedules Direct channel editor and unselect any channels that
  you can't tune without the STB.  This will usually be channels higher
  than 125, but check your CATV provider lineup if you're not sure.
  Once you've deselected them (using a click on the first channel you
  can't receive and then a shift-click on the last channel you can't
  receive will deselect all the channels in between those two.) click
  the Save Changes button at the bottom of the screen.

  In [1mmythtv-setup[22m, create a Video Source with an appropriate name.  "SD-
  Analog Only" will be used in this example.  Click "Retrieve Lineups"
  and select the digital lineup you just created at Schedules Direct.
  Click "Finish" to return to the Video sources selector and then press
  the ESC key to go back to the main screen.

  Now choose Input Connections.  Select the PVR-150 which is connected
  directly to the CATV.  Set the Video Source to "SD-Analog Only" and
  click "Fetch channels from listings source".

  Set the start channel to an appropriate value.

  [1mNOTE[22m:  There is a bug where the "Fetch" command may not work; you can
  tell that the Fetch did not retrieve any channels in one of two ways:
  in the text-mode console, you will see a connection to Schedules
  Direct, but it doesn't appear to retrieve any channel information:


       2007-08-25 15:03:05.526 New DB DataDirect connection

  or, the "Please add channels to this source" message in the "Starting
  channel" field stays on the screen.

  If either of these happens, save the information on this screen by
  clicking the "Finish" button.  Exit back to the Input connections
  screen by pressing ESC, then select this Input Connection again.  This
  time the Fetch will work and the "Please add channels to this source"
  message will disappear.

  If you look at the text-mode console, you'll see this if the channel
  retrieval is working:

  Repeat the Input Connection configuration for any other capture
  devices that are connected directly to the CATV system.  You do not
  need to click Fetch once you've done one successful download of the
  channel information - the Starting channel should be automatically
  populated.


  Go back to Schedules Direct and re-enable the channels that you had
  previously deselected, then click Save Changes.

  Create a new Video Source, here called "SD-All Digital Channels".
  Perform the same "Retrieve Listings" you did before.

  Go back to the Input Connections screen, select the PVR-250 which is
  connected to the STB, assign the "SD-All Digital Channels" video
  source and perform a retrieve channels.  This will pull down the
  complete channel listing, but only for [4mthis[24m device.

  When [1mmythfilldatabase [22mruns, it will cache the "big" download which is
  appropriate for the STB, and then copy the information to the channels
  that can only be accessed without the STB.  But by default
  [1mmythfilldatabase [22mis going to notice that the "Analog only" video
  source is missing the channels that are in the Digital lineup you
  created at Schedules Direct, so we need to override the addition of
  new channels.

  When you run [1mmythfilldatabase [22mto populate your database, you'll need
  to run it like this:



       $ mythfilldatabase --remove-new-channels



  You will also need to modify how the [1mmythbackend [22mcalls
  [1mmythfilldatabase [22mwhen it performs its automatic listings update.

  In [1mmythfrontend[22m, select "Setup" -> "General".

  Continue press ENTER until you reach the Mythfilldatabase
  configuration screen.  In the "mythfilldatabase Arguments" field, type
  --remove-new-channels

  then press the TAB key until you reach Finish, then press ENTER to
  save.  You can then press ESC until you return to the main screen.
