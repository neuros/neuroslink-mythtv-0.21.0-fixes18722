<P>MythTV does not have native remote control receiver and decoder software
built-in.  Instead, remote control functions are implemented by cooperating
with <B>lirc</B>, the Linux Infrared Remote Control program.  <B>lirc</B>
handles the IR hardware and passes keystrokes to MythTV, which then acts as
if the user had pressed the keys on the keyboard.  The file
<CODE>keys.txt</CODE> describes the keys used to control MythTV.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss8.2">8.2</A> <A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO.html#toc8.2">Obtaining and compiling lirc</A>
</H2>

<P>You're going to need to download and compile <B>lircd</B>.  Go to 
<A HREF="http://www.lirc.org">http://www.lirc.org</A> and download lirc; as
of 2006-01-21, the version available is 0.8.0.  Grab the remotes.tar.bz2 file as
well.

You're going to need to know what sort of receiver you have and where it's
connected.  In the case of the Pinnacle Studio TV card, with the IR receiver
connected to COM1 (/dev/ttys0), once the configuration menu comes up,
perform the configuration by going to Driver Configuration->Other Serial
Port Devices->Pinnacle Systems Receiver->OK and on the next page select
COM1->OK.</P>
<P>Each remote is different; some remote receivers connect directly to your
capture card and not to a serial port, so make sure that you've got the
correct one.</P>
<P>You then click "Save Configuration and run configure" to continue.</P>
<P>Make sure you read the last text generated by the configure step. It will
tell you if you require a kernel recompile, and what the name of your kernel
module will be (if necessary). For instance a home-built receiver may
require a kernel recompile, so you would be notified that you will have to
load the lirc_serial module. If you did not get any such messages skip the
kernel recompile steps below and go directly to making and installing the
lirc driver.</P>
<P>Once the configuration step is complete:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ make
$ su
# make install
# chmod 666 /dev/lircd
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>At this point, if you're using a serial receiver, check that there's a
<CODE>lirc</CODE> device in <CODE>/dev</CODE>:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ ls -l /dev/li*
lr-xr-xr-x    1 root     root            5 Jan 27 09:00 /dev/lirc -> ttyS0

</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>As you can see, there's a link from /dev/lirc to ttyS0, a.k.a. "COM1", which is
appropriate for the Pinnacle Systems PCTV Pro.  However, you may notice
something like this:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

Some IR receivers (including some homebrew units) use a character device as
their data interface as opposed to a link to a serial port.  If the <CODE>make
install</CODE> step has created a character device for you, don't replace it
with a link to a COM port.</P>
<P>So, if the link or character device was not created (but should have been),
ensure that you ran the <CODE>make install</CODE> step as root.  If it still
doesn't work, then there are three options.  The first option is to re-read
the <B>lirc</B> documentation to determine whether your IR receiver is a
character device or should be a link to a serial port and to create the
link/character device manually.  In this example, the IR device is connected
to ttyS0.  If it were connected to "COM2", then use ttyS1, etc.

<CAPTION><B>NOTE</B>:  The above example assumes that your receiver uses the
standard serial driver.  Some receivers do not, including receivers that
plug into a TV capture card.  Check the lirc documentation, but it may be
necessary to replace the link created above with a character pipe:</CAPTION>

<P>See the lirc documentation for additional information.  The lirc
installation <EM>should</EM> create this for you, so manually creating it
indicates that your lirc installation may have other issues.</P>
<P>The second option is to post your issue to the <EM>lirc</EM> list, not the
mythtv-users list.  The lirc programmers will be the ones that can assist
you best.</P>
<P>The third option is to dispense with lirc altogether by purchasing an IR
keyboard (various options exist, although Chicony appears to work for some
people) and a learning remote control.  The IR keyboard receiver plugs into
the PS/2 keyboard port on your PC and you would train your learning remote
to emulate the various keystrokes from <CODE>keys.txt</CODE> of your IR
keyboard.  Using this method removes lirc entirely from the picture - your
remote will be sending keypresses that your PC "sees" on the keyboard port.</P>

</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P><B>NOTE</B>:  Read this next section if you're not familiar with how lirc works!</P>
<P>There are two separate files used by lirc, and both are required for your
remote control to do anything useful. First is the <CODE>lircd.conf</CODE> file. 
<CODE>lircd.conf</CODE> tells the lirc daemon how to interpret the IR pulses
that it receives from a remote control and what name to assign to each
sequence of pulses.  Without getting too involved, a particular series of
pulses may correlate to "Channel Up".  The <CODE>lircd.conf</CODE> file will
then contain a line that looks something like this:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
          ChannelUp                0x0000000000001020
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>The <CODE>lircd.conf</CODE> file can have multiple remote controls defined.</P>
<P>The second file is <CODE>lircrc</CODE>, which takes the name of the button which
was pressed ("ChannelUp") in the above example, and correlates that to an
action to be performed by a program using the remote control.  So in MythTV,
ChannelUp means one thing, while in <B>mplayer</B> it means something
different.  <CODE>lircrc</CODE> gives you the flexibility of taking the name of
the button and having it perform different actions depending on which
program you're using at the time.</P>
<P><B>NOTE</B>:  The definitions in <CODE>lircd.conf</CODE> come from the user
community, and there is no standard for the common button names.  One
<CODE>lircd.conf</CODE> file may contain a definition for a button called
"ChannelUp", while another may contain a definition for "Chan+".  Your
<CODE>lircrc</CODE> file must therefore be configured appropriately, or it won't
work.</P>
<P>If this fails, complaining of a missing <CODE>lircd.conf</CODE> file, then you
must find or make one. First look for a pre-made configuration file at 
<A HREF="http://lirc.sourceforge.net/remotes/">http://lirc.sourceforge.net/remotes/</A>.  Mandriva 9.1 users, look in
<CODE>/usr/share/lirc-remotes</CODE>. If you find one your remotes either on the
website or in <CODE>/usr/share</CODE>, download or copy the file, name it
<CODE>lircd.conf</CODE> and put it in your <CODE>/etc</CODE> directory. If you
couldn't find your remote, you must make your own <CODE>lircd.conf</CODE> file.</P>
<P>To make your own <CODE>lircd.conf</CODE> file
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ irrecord myremote

</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Follow the on-screen directions to train your remote and define keys. If  
your remote ends up working well, you should consider submitting your  
<CODE>lircd.conf</CODE> file back to the lirc developers. Once finished:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ su
# cp myremote /etc/lircd.conf
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>now try to start lircd again:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# /usr/local/sbin/lircd
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Now, we're going to add the commands necessary for lircd to run each time we
boot. Mandriva 9.1 users, you can execute:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ su
# chkconfig --level 35 lircd on
# exit

</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>All other distributions:

</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
 </P>
<P>This takes care of the lircd portion, which "listens" for the IR signals. If
everything went well, the install script for lircd put an appropriate
configuration file for your remote into <CODE>/etc/lircd.conf</CODE> This file
maps the buttons on the remote control to the IR pulses coming from the
receiver.</P>
<P>The next step is to convert those signals into something that can be used

if you've got a Pinnacle Studio PCTV remote.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

$ irw

</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Start pressing the keys on your remote; <B>irw</B> will
print the name of the button as it is defined in your
<CODE>/etc/lircd.conf</CODE>. If you don't see anything at this point, you need
to troubleshoot further by going back to the lirc home page and investigating
from there.</P>
<P>If it is working, then press <B>CTRL-C</B> to abort the program.  Once you
know that your remote is working, you can either recompile MythTV with
native lirc support by enabling it in <B>configure</B> or you
need to run the <B>irxevent</B> program, which takes the key presses and
sends them to MythTV.  If you use native lirc support, you don't need to run
<B>irxevent</B>.  If you are going to use irxevent, then you need to run
it like this:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ irxevent &amp;
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

If <B>irxevent</B> isn't running, then MythTV will not respond to your remote
control unless you're using native lirc support.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss8.4">8.4</A> <A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO.html#toc8.4">Additional information for lirc</A>
</H2>

<P>Take a look at the lircrc.example files in the <CODE>contrib/configfiles/</CODE>
directory.  In my case, (Pinnacle Studio card) the channel up and down functions
weren't working, due to the fact that the button names were different than
the default <CODE>lircrc.example</CODE> file that came with MythTV.</P>
<P>The <CODE>lircrc.example</CODE> file has this:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
begin
    prog = irxevent
    button = ChannelUp
    config = Key Up CurrentWindow
end

begin
    prog = irxevent
    button = ChannelDown
    config = Key Down CurrentWindow
end
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

but the <CODE>/etc/lircd.conf</CODE> that comes in the lircd package 
defines the buttons for the Pinnacle Studio PCTV as:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
          channel+                 0x0000000000000017
          channel-                 0x000000000000001C
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

rather than "ChannelUp" and "ChannelDown".  I added the 
following to my /home/[yourusername]/.lircrc file:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
begin
    prog = irxevent
    button = channel+
    repeat = 3
    config = Key Up CurrentWindow
end

begin
    prog = irxevent
    button = channel-
    repeat = 3
    config = Key Down CurrentWindow
end
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

which took care of basic functionality.  Because the PCTV Studio remote
has additional buttons, look at the
<CODE>contrib/configfiles/lircrc.example.pinnaclestudiopctv</CODE> for an example of how
to define additional buttons, and how to debug potential button name
conflicts between the <CODE>lircrc.example</CODE> file and how <B>your</B>
remote defines the button names.</P>
<P>By examining the button names defined in <CODE>/etc/lircd.conf</CODE> and using
the <B>irw</B> program to make sure that your remote is working, you can
create the appropriate mappings in <CODE>.lircrc</CODE> to get excellent remote
functionality with MythTV.</P>
<P>Note the <B>repeat =</B> parameter.  This informs the <CODE>irxevent</CODE>
program to pass through every third keypress.  By default, <CODE>lirc</CODE>
will only send one keypress to the application, even if you're holding down
the key.  The actual <B>repeat =</B> number will vary from system to
system, so experiment and see which value works best for you.</P>

<P>Lirc has support for various IR transmitters. A popular model is the Actisys
IR-200L 
<A HREF="http://store.snapstreamstore.com/accessories.html">http://store.snapstreamstore.com/accessories.html</A>. It was
originally designed for IRDA communication, but can be used to transmit A/V remote
control codes. By using the lirc SIR driver, this device can easily be
integrated with MythTV. I have tested this device with an AT&amp;T DCT2000
digital cable box but the instructions can be used to configure other IRDA
devices and A/V remotes.</P>
<P>Follow the steps in the previous section.  When you run setup.sh, select
option 1, driver configuration. From here select option 6, IrDA hardware.

Below is a copy of the script followed by the corresponding perl script.
Make sure both are in your path. Also make sure you leave the #!/bin/csh
