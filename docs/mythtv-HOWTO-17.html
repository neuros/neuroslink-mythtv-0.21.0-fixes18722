<P>MythMusic has a number of prerequisites that must be satisfied before it
is operational.  Depending on your distribution, some of these prerequisites can
be satisfied through the various package managers.  If your distribution doesn't
offer pre-compiled versions of the software below, then follow the generic
instructions for manually compiling and installing the software.</P>

<LI>MAD</LI>
<LI>taglib</LI>
<LI>libogg and libvorbis</LI>

<H2><A NAME="ss17.2">17.2</A> <A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO.html#toc17.2">Mandriva</A>
</H2>

<P>Mandriva has a number of the prerequisites available on the
installation CD.  Some of the software you're going to need will have to be
obtained from the "contrib" or "cooker" development repositories. 
Applications downloaded from "cooker" come from the development branch, so
there may be issues with some software.  It isn't recommended that you mix
cooker and release-level software.</P>

<P><B>urpmi</B> is the simplest tool for installation of packages from the
command line.  The difficult part is the configuration, but this has been
made easier at the following website: 
<A HREF="http://addmedia.linuxfornewbies.org/">http://addmedia.linuxfornewbies.org/</A> The website will allow
you to choose a mirror site and then present the command-line configuration
text for that mirror.  You will most likely need to add a "Contrib" mirror
to your setup.  Once you have done that, you can proceed.  If <B>urpmi</B>
prompts you about other modules that need to be installed to satisfy
dependencies, say "Yes".</P>
<P>

<H3>Additional options with MythMusic</H3>

<P>Additional visualizations have been added to MythMusic.  If you wish to
use these, there are some prerequisites you must install prior to compiling.</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>fftw</LI>
<LI>OpenGL</LI>
<LI>SDL</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P><CODE>fftw</CODE> may be obtained from

<H2><A NAME="ss17.3">17.3</A> <A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO.html#toc17.3">Red Hat Linux 9</A>
</H2>

<P>Red Hat provides packages for several of the prerequisites, making 
installation very simple. Of the prerequisites, Red Hat provides 
packages for Vorbis, cdparanoia, SDL, and OpenGL (which you probably 
already have installed). To install these all at once, simply type (all on
the same line):
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ up2date --solvedeps libvorbis libvorbis-devel vorbis-tools cdparanoia-devel cdparanoia-libs cdparanoia SDL-devel SDL
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>If you get the following message: "None of the packages you requested 
were found, or they are already updated" it probably means you already 
have all of those packages installed.</P>
<P>You must install the remaining packages, (MAD, FLAC, libcdaudio and
optionally fftw) manually following the installation directions above. When
installing fftw do not use the rpm package offered on the website because it
will cause an error, so use the source package instead.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss17.5">17.5</A> <A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO.html#toc17.5">Configuring MythMusic</A>
</H2>

<P>Configuration of MythMusic occurs in two places.  The main mythfrontend
Setup is for global MythMusic configuration.  Go to the
Setup/MythMusic/General Setup screen and adjust it for your particular
configuration.</P>
<P>The second configuration screen is within the MythMusic program and will
allow you rescan your music library, etc.</P>
<P>Here's some explanation about the Ignore_ID3 and The NonID3FileNameFormat:</P>
<P>If Ignore_ID3 is set to TRUE, MythMusic will try to determine the
Genre, Artist, Album, Track Number, and Title from the filename of the
mp3 file.  The NonID3FileNameFormat variable should be set to the
directory/file format where the mp3 files are stored.  For instance, I
store mine in the above shown Genre/Artist/Album/Track format.  MythMusic
will then use this information to fill in the proper fields when it
populates the musicmetadata table rather than searching for an ID3 tag in
the mp3 file.</P>
<P>The files can be laid out in any format, such as:</P>
<P>Genre/Artist/Album/Title
Artist/Genre/Album/Title
Artist/Album/Title (with Genre left as Unknown)</P>
<P>The track number is optional but can be specified with the title by using
the TRACK_TITLE keyword instead of TITLE.  If TRACK_TITLE is used,
then the filename can have a space, hyphen, or underscore separating the
track number from the track title.  Keywords are case insensitive, so if
you specify GENRE it's the same as Genre in the format field.</P>
<P>The Ignore_ID3 option does not disable the code that determines the track
length, just the portion that tries to read ID3 info.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss17.6">17.6</A> <A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO.html#toc17.6">Using MythMusic</A>
</H2>

<P>MythMusic is fairly simple to use.  It is recommended that you insert the
CD before selecting "Import CD".  You should also ensure that your system
doesn't try to automount the CD and begin playing it automatically.</P>
<P>Here's some information on playlist management:</P>
<P>Q: How do I create a new playlist?  
A: Using the MythMusic "Select Music" menu option, setup the playlist as you
normally would by adding songs or other playlists as needed.  When you are
ready to save the new playlist, highlight "Active Play Queue" at the bottom
of the selection tree and hit the "i" key. This will pop up a menu allowing
you to name and save the new playlist.  You can also hit Enter to bring up
the popup on the Active Play Queue. This does not work on the playlists
above, as Enter is obviously bound to checking/unchecking the boxes. Any
number (i.e. keypad on remote) will also bring up the menu in both cases.</P>
<P>Q: How do I enter the playlist name in the text field without a keyboard?
A: Use the keypad number keys (bound to your remote) to select letters
quasi-cell phone style. Keys 2-9 work pretty much like any cell phone text
entry. 1 cycles through a few special characters, delete, and space. 0 is
like a CAPS LOCK. Hard to describe, fairly easy to use. You will soon be
able to specify the cycle timing in a Setup screen. You can type fairly
quickly through a combination of jumping around the number keys AND hitting
a non-number key (right arrow is particularly good for this) to force the
current character.</P>
<P>Q: How do I edit a playlist? 
A: Highlight the playlist in the selection tree and hit the "i" key then
select "Move to Active Play Queue" in the popup.  You can now modify the
"Active Play Queue" like normal, adding songs and playlists by selecting
them from the song tree.  When you are done, highlight the "Active Play
Queue" in the selection tree and hit the "i" key then select "Save Back to
Playlist Tree".  And whatever you were editing as your Active Queue before
you moved an existing playlist "on top" of Active reappears. Think of Active
has having a push on, pop off capability, but with a depth of only 1.</P>
<P>Q: How do I delete an item from a playlist?
A: Highlight the item in the selection tree and hit the "d" key.</P>
<P>Q: How do I rearrange the songs in my playlist?
A: Highlight a song and hit the "space" bar, the song will now have pair of
red arrows in front of it.  Use the up and down arrow keys to move it around
in the playlist.  When you have it where you want it, hit the "space" bar
again.</P>
<P>Q: How do I delete a playlist?
A: Highlight the playlist in the selection tree and hit the "i" key then
select "Delete this Playlist" from the popup.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss17.7">17.7</A> <A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO.html#toc17.7">Troubleshooting MythMusic</A>
</H2>

<P>You may run into errors when running MythMusic.</P>
<H3>When I run MythMusic and try and look up a CD, I get an error message </H3>

<P>The full text of the message will say: </P>
<P>databasebox.o: Couldn't find your CD. It may not be in the freedb database. 
More likely, however, is that you need to delete &nbsp;/.cddb and &nbsp;/.cdserverrc
and restart mythmusic. Have a nice day.</P>
<P>If you get this message, you should go to the home directory of whatever
user MythMusic is running as and type:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
rm .cdserverrc
rm -rf .cddb/
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>These files aren't automatically deleted because of a conscious design
decision by the author that programs that automatically delete things are
bad.</P>
<P>The files are used to locally cache CD lookups. If you are re-inserting
CDs, your machine will not actually have to go out to the Internet to
determine what is on them.  However, the URL used to access the freedb
database has recently changed, so the stale information in the files from
previous runs of MythMusic would cause the error above.  Once the files have
been deleted the stale information will be gone and your local database
will be rebuilt as you use CDs.</P>
