README for trailer.pl by Andrei Rjeousski (arjeousski@gmail.com)

This script is similar on imdb.pl but can be used to get the URLs for the
ACTUAL movie trailers based on IMDB #.

The script parses apple.com website and tries to find a large trailer and if
thats not available, it gets regular trailer.

Heres the example:
# ./trailer.pl -T 0356150
http://movies.apple.com/movies/dreamworks/eurotrip/eurotrip_m480.mov

This script can be used for getting pretty much any trailers for either
upcoming movies or the movies that are currently in the database
