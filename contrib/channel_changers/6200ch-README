6200ch is a small program that Stacey Son (mythdev@son.org) wrote to change
channels on a Motorola DCT-6200 cable box via a 1394 (aka. Firewire)
connection.

I was working on some code to record the video/audio via firewire, however,
I have noticed that my cable provider has started to encrypt (5C/DTCP) many
of the channels that I care to record.  I am currently using a s-video
cable, a PVR-250 and this code with mythtv until I figure out something
better to do.  This works with for DCT-6200 but may be easy to modify for
other firewire tuners as well.

To use this with mythtv do the following:

(1) Make sure you have 1394/Firewire drivers installed in your kernel.

(2) Install libraw1394, librom1394 and libavc1394.   (On gentoo:  "emerge
libavc1394").

(3) Compile and install "6200ch":

      # cc -std=gnu99 -o 6200ch 6200ch.c -lavc1394 -lrom1394 -lraw1394
      # cp 6200ch /usr/local/bin

(4) Connect a 1394/Firewire cable from your computer to your DCT-6200 and
test:

      # 6200ch <your_favorite_channel_number>

(5) Configure Mythtv to use the channel changer by running the "setup"
program and adding to "/usr/local/bin/6200ch" to the "External channel
change command" field under "Connect source to Input".

Enjoy!
