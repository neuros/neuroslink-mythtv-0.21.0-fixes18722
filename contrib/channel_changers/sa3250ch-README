sa3250ch is a small program that changes channels on a Scientific Atlanta
SA3250HD cable box via a 1394 (aka. Firewire) connection. It is based off
of 6200ch by Stacey Son (mythdev@son.org).

To use this with mythtv do the following:

(1) Make sure you have 1394/Firewire drivers installed in your kernel.

(2) Install libraw1394, librom1394 and libavc1394.

(3) Compile and install "sa3250ch":

      # cc -o sa3250ch sa3250ch.c -lrom1394 -lavc1394 -lraw1394
      # cp sa3250ch /usr/local/bin

(4) Connect a 1394/Firewire cable from your computer to your SA3250HD and test:

      # sa3250ch <your_favorite_channel_number>

(5) Configure Mythtv to use the channel changer by running the "setup"
program and adding to "/usr/local/bin/sa3250ch" to the "External channel
change command" field under "Connect source to Input".

I'm curious if this works for anybody on other SciAtl boxes when the proper
model IDs are added.
