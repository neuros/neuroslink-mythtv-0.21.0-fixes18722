 If you are intended on installing this on a standalone/non-desktop machine,
 you should look into the metapackages available:
 mythtv-backend-master (backend with a local database)
 mythtv-backend (backend needing a remote database)

Recommends: mythweb
Description: Metapackage to setup and configure a "Master Backend" profile of MythTV.
 This package will install and configure all necessary packages for this machine
 to behave as a "Master" Backend for a mythtv network.  This package is intended to
 be installed on the machine that will behave as the first (and possibly only)
 backend for the network.  Typically, this package will be installed on a server rather then a desktop.
 It makes no sense to install it on anything but the first backend machine on the network.

Description: Metapackage to setup and configure a "Frontend" profile of MythTV.
 This package will install and configure all necessary packages for this machine
 to behave as a standalone Frontend for a mythtv network.  This package is intended
 to be installed after a backend has been configured on the network.  Also, this
 package is intended for usage on a standalone machine only running MythTV.  A machine already
 configured as a desktop should install mythtv-frontend instead.  Without a running and
 accessible backend, this package will not properly function.
