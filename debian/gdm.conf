# GDM Configuration file.
#
# This file should not be updated by hand.  Since GDM 2.13.0.4,
# configuration choices in the /etc/X11/gdm/gdm.conf-custom file will
# override the default values specified in this file (installation 
# locations of the configuration files may vary for different distros).
# This defaults.conf file may be overwritten on upgrade, so to ensure
# that your configuration choices are not lost, please make sure that 
# your changes are made only the the custom.conf file.
#
# If you were using an older version of GDM, your system may have the
# the older gdm.conf configuration file on the system.  If so, then this
# file is used instead of the custom.conf file for backwards support.
# If you make changes to the custom.conf file and they seem to not be
# taking effect, this is likely the problem.  Consider migrating your
# configuration to the new custom.conf file and removing the gdm.conf
# file.
#
# You can use the gdmsetup program to graphically edit the gdm.conf-custom
# file.  Note that gdmsetup does not support every option in this file, just
# the most common ones that users want to change.  If you feel that
# gdmsetup should support additional configuration options, please file a
# bug report at http://bugzilla.gnome.org/.
#
# If you hand-edit the GDM configuration, you should run the following command
# to get the GDM daemon to recognize the change.  Any running GDM GUI programs
# will also be notified to update with the new configuration.
#
# gdmflexiserver --command="UPDATE_CONFIG <configuration key>"
#
# e.g, the "Enable" key in the "[debug]" section would be "debug/Enable".
#
# You can also run gdm-restart or gdm-safe-restart to cause GDM to restart and
# re-read the new configuration settings.  You can also restart GDM by sending
# a HUP or USR1 signal to the daemon.  HUP behaves like gdm-restart and causes
# any user session started by GDM to exit immediately while USR1 behaves like
# gdm-safe-restart and will wait until all users log out before restarting GDM.
