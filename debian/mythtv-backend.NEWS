mythtv (0.15.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * As of version 0.15-1, the tv_grab_na grabber from xmltv is now
    deprecated in favour of the Zap2It Data Direct service.  If you are
    using tv_grab_na, you must register for the new service and run
    mythtv-setup to configure MythTV to use it.  See:
  
    http://www.mythtv.org/docs/mythtv-HOWTO-21.html#MigratingtoDD
  
    for instructions.
