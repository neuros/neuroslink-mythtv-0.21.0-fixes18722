UPGRADING FROM RELEASE 0.11 and up
----------------------------------
Database updates are now done automatically.

UPGRADING FROM RELEASE 0.10
---------------------------
Update your database with the 0.10-to-0.11.sql script.

UPGRADING FROM RELEASE 0.9
--------------------------
Update your database with the 0.9-to-0.10.sql script.

UPGRADING FROM RELEASE 0.8
--------------------------
Update your database with the 0-8-to-0-9.sql script.

UPGRADING FROM RELEASE 0.7
--------------------------
Insert the 0-7-to-0-8.sql file from the database/ subdir into your database.
The old settings files (settings.txt, theme.txt) are no longer used and can 
be deleted from /usr/local/share/mythtv/ and ~/.mythtv/
Run the setup program included in the setup/ directory, and say yes to both
questions it asks on the console, before it opens the UI.  Follow the rest of
the setup instructions from the README, from here on out.

UPGRADING FROM RELEASE 0.6
--------------------------
No database changes have been made.

UPGRADING FROM RELEASE 0.5
--------------------------
You'll need to insert the 0-5-to-0-6.sql file in the database/ subdir into
your database.  Run the setup program included in the setup/ directory after
compiling, and you should be all set.  Please note that upgrading will wipe
out most scheduled recordings in your database.  Sorry about that, but there
really wasn't any clean way to migrate the data over to the new database
format.

UPGRADING FROM RELEASE 0.4
--------------------------
You don't need to do anything other than re-edit the settings.txt file.
Just remember to run the ./configure script to setup libavcodec before
making MythTV.

UPGRADING FROM PREVIEW RELEASE 3
--------------------------------
Do the same thing for conflictupdate.sql.  Not needed for a new install.
The channel icons were moved from /usr/local/share/mythtv/ to ~/.mythtv/channels
They'll be updated the next time you run the filldata script.  You can remove
all the .jpg and .gif files from the /usr/local/share/mythtv/ directory, if
you want.

UPGRADING FROM PREVIEW RELEASE 2
--------------------------------
Follow the above instructions to add record.sql.  Do the same thing for
conflict.sql.  Again, not needed for a new install.

UPGRADING FROM PREVIEW RELEASE 1
--------------------------------
You need to add the record.sql script to the database, so, mysql < record.sql
This is not needed on a new install.
